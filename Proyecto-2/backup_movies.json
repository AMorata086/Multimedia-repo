        "sinopsis": "Charlie, the father (Charles Chaplin) and his family are off for a rattling good time. Two children, a beautiful mother (Edna Purviance) and Charlie leave the house and enter their Model T Ford. Charlie attempts to start the car. It shimmers and shakes but the engine dies, every time Charlies tries to enter the driver seat. Turning the starting crank handle the opposite way causes smoke shoots out. Finally, a minor adjustment to the engine and they are on their way.The family enters the ferry boat. Charlie carries one child under each arm because children in arms are free. They find their seats. Charlie leaves momentarily. In his absence, his seat is occupied by a large man (Tom Wilson) and his wife (Babe London). Charlie wedges his way in when he returns. He sticks the man with a pin to make room. Then Charlie leaves the boat again to buy cigarettes.The captain calls all aboard and the boat starts to pull away from the pier. A heavy woman (Tom Wood) arrives just as the boat is depart and fires her baby carriage across the bow. She trips as she tries to board and stretches herself between the boat and the landing. When Charlie returns, he is able to walk across the woman's back to board the boat. The heavy set woman falls into the water. Charlie thinks it may be helpful to use a gaff pole to help her climb onto the boat. Finally, she is helped on board and the trip is underway.A black band of ragtime musicians provides music. Several couples begin dancing. Charlie and his wife are among them. Dancing is a challenge as the boat tosses in the waves. Charlie and many others do not look like they are feeling too well overcome with seasickness. With rougher waters, the dance floor clears and many people cling to the edge of the boat. Charlie tries to find his balance on the dance floor alone. Eventually, Charlie finds a seat near the trombone player and has to navigate the trombone's slide continually. Charles, the trombone player and the drummer all are consumed with the same thought of seasickness. The trombone player is so ill his face turns white. Charlies seeks another location.A vendor pressures Charlie to buy ham sandwiches, buttered popcorn, cigars or cigarettes. Charlie returns to his snoozing family and struggles to set up a deck chair. The fat couple who occupied the seat earlier are near. The fat man eats popcorn, feels ill and leaves. Frustrated, Charlie throws the deck chair overboard and seats himself next to the fat woman. She is also not feeling well and faints into Charlie's lap. Charlie props her up but succumbs to the seasickness can keels over face first into the woman's lap. A steward comes along and puts a blanket over Charlie and the woman. The man returns, bringing a drink for his wife. Charlie extends his arm from under the blanket. The man thinks he is holding his wife's hand as Charlies wave his rejection of the drink. When Charlie is discovered under the blanket, the man flings Charlie across the deck and a fight ensues. Charlie is choked repeatedly but is saved when the man runs across the deck to lean over the edge with sea sickness. Charlie finds this the ideal opportunity to kick the man's posterior. Then Charlie pulls him away and dominates the fight with the much larger man. The captain finally intercedes in the fight between the two very tired and seasick men. At the end of the cruise, the day trippers disembark. The large man Charlie was fighting has a black eye.On the way home, the family encounters a hold up at the crossroads where a traffic officer directs traffic. When Charlie's Model T approaches the corner, Charlie fails to yield to the traffic cop's direction. The traffic officer politely asks Charlie to reverse back to the corner and wait. A woman pedestrian meets another lady and her husband crossing the street in front of Charlie's car. Charlie blows his horn repeatedly but they do not move. The short little man (Loyal Underwood) leans against Charlie's car tire. Charlie reverses the car and the man tumbles to the ground. Finally, the pedestrians retreat to the street corner. The man cusses out Charlie as a stupid ass. Charlie plugs his ears with his fingers.Charlie again tries to proceed with his left turn. The traffic cop stops him again. This time he issues Charlie a citation. When Charlie backs his car to the corner, he bumps into a truck carrying a large box which tips over onto another vehicle with a well-dressed man inside. The traffic offer intervenes. The well-dressed man's car is allowed to proceed. The truck forced to back up.As Charlie waits, men wheel a barrel of tar out in front of Charlie's car. When another car backs up, the barrel of hot tar in spilled in front of Charlie's car. Charlie pulls ahead and his car become stuck. Charlie cannot move ahead when the traffic officer signals him. A portly officer (Henry Bergman) approaches and clears the tar bucket and street workers from the scene. The officer is forced backward by another car reversing and gets his feet stuck in the tar. Now both Charlie's car and the officer are stuck in the tar. The traffic officer approaches to give Charlie yet another citation. The portly officer frees himself from the tar. In the process, he steps on a manhole cover behind the traffic officer and removes it. The traffic officer disappears down the manhole. The portly officer replaces the manhole cover and approaches Charlie. When Charlie notices him, he says \"how you have changed.\" This results in a confrontation where Charlie is pulled from his car by the portly officer and tossed back into the tar. Charlie's feet are so embedded in the tar that he can lean forward without falling over much to the delight of the growing crowd of pedestrians. The portly officer tells him \"you've been sticking around here long enough.\" As the altercation continues, the portly officer ends up with both feet and hands stuck in the tar. The traffic officer climbs out of the manhole and trips over the other officer. The traffic officer also ends up stuck in the tar. Charlie removes his shoes steps on the officer's hat and climbs down the officers back to free himself from the sticky situation. Charlie climbs back into his car, puts it in reverse, and drives around *the officers who are still stuck, one on top of the other. It is the end of a perfect day. 7*"

        "sinopsis": "THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARIFrancis (Friedrich Feher) and an older man are sitting in a garden, telling stories. A girl (Lil Dagover) walks past, unresponsive, as in a daze. Francis says she is his fiancée Jane and that the story of how she got that way will be amazing.It all started when a carnival came to his hometown of Hostenwall . . . (we go into flashback) . . .Francis and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) together with Jane go to the carnival for fun. They are enticed by an older mountebank (Werner Krauss) calling himself Dr. Caligari to enter his tent to see his amazing somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's command, is about to awaken.After some people enter the tent and sit down, Dr. Caligari opens a vertical cabinet shaped like a mummys sarcophagus, and we see Cesare is a gaunt young man who wakes and steps forward in extreme slow motion. Supposedly he spends his life sleeping in the cabinet and is able to predict the future when awake. Caligari brags that Cesare can answer any question whatsoever.When Alan asks Cesare how long he has to live, the answer is that Alan will die before dawn tomorrow. This unsettling prediction cuts their fun short, so Alan, Francis, and Jane go home. Jane is particularly affected, since, at that time, she was Alans girl friend although she knew that Francis was also in love with her.After night comes, we see, inside Alan's rooms, the shadows of Alan and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall.Alan is found murdered the next morning. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange handler.Before police do anything, an attempted murder of an old woman takes place, throwing the town into panic.Back at Dr. Caligari's wagon, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he sits in a coffin. When police knock at the wagon asking questions, they are shown Cesare inside the coffin, and Caligari protests that he doesnt ever leave the coffin without his permission.At some point a common criminal confesses to the attempted murder of the old lady, so the police are back to investigating Alans murder only. Francis, along with Jane, keep investigating Caligari and Cesare.\nCaligari orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he lifts a knife to kill her, she screams and faints. He carries Jane out of her house, leading the townsfolk on a lengthy chase. Cesare falls from a height to his death to end the pursuit.The townsfolk discover a dummy in Cesare's cabinet, and that Caligari has fled.Francis goes to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether the fled Dr. Caligari might be a patient there. The worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the director of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to discuss any of that.Francis goes to the director's office and it turns out the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same person.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through books and notebooks in the office, they discover a historical book about a mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1793 in northern Italy. The XIth century Caligari used a hypnotized somnambulist to murder people. The director has notes to suggest he is trying to recreate the XIth Century events.When the director arrives, after being confronted with the dead Cesare, he goes nuts, saying he must become the new Caligari, so staff in the institute put him in a straight jacket. His mania is manifest, and he is confined in his own asylum.At this point the flashback is over. The expressionist look of buildings is gone. Francis and the man who was told the story wander back from the garden to the institute patio. Cesare is standing in the corner and Francis warns the older man not to accept one of his prophecies, for he would surely die.Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood.Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari (the director), and Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with him. Francis is grabbed by the staff and taken upstairs.Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is a maniac and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk.The twist ending reveals that all of the flashback is actually Francis delusion, symbolized in the film by the distorted buildings and landscapes. Francis, Jane and Cesare are all inmates of the insane asylum, and the man he calls Caligari is the asylum director. The director, after this revelation of the sources of his patient's delusion, says that now he should be able to cure Francis."

Sisters Cora and Alice Munro are entertaining soldiers by playing music and dancing when Uncas arrives. Cora is impressed with his noble appearance, and is chided by English officer Captain Randolph for admiring a savage.The sisters' father Colonel Munro, defending Fort William Henry, learns of the approach of a large army of French, allied with Huron warriors. He sends a request for reinforcements to Fort Edward by way of the \"indian runner,\" Magua. The sisters do not accompany the troops, but instead Magua leads them on a shortcut through the forest. Magua (who, in the novel, has old bad blood with the Munros, but here is just villainous) abandons them to find some Hurons to capture them. Running into Uncas, Hawkeye, and Chief Great Serpent, the girls and their escort (Major Heyward, who is in love with \"capricious Alice\") take refuge in a cave. Magua and the indians arrive in the morning. Several of the men run from the cave, hoping to draw off the Hurons, but they find the sisters and their fellow travellers and take them prisoner. Uncas and Hawkeye liberate them, and get them to Fort William Henry.Being snubbed by Cora, who now admires Uncas even more, Captain Randolph secretly visits the French General Montcalm and exposes the fort's weaknesses. Armed with this knowledge, the general negotiates the surrender of the fort, with the agreement that the women and children will not be harmed. But the French have given the Hurons firewater, and in their drunken wildness, Magua is able to incite them to attack the wagon train, massacring the women, then destroying and burning the fort. Magua kidnaps Cora and Alice. Hawkeye, Uncas, and the chief follow him to his refuge among the peaceful Delaware Indians. Dispensing justice, the Delware chief awards Cora to Uncas and Hawkeye, but Alice to Magua. Cora offers herself in Alice's place, since she knows she's the one Magua really wants, and they leave. The Delawares declare sanctuary until sundown, after which Hawkeye, Uncas, and the chief follow.Escaping from Magua's campsite, Cora flees to the top of a huge cliff and threatens to throw herself off. Magua sits, waiting for her to fall asleep. Uncas arrives just as Magua seizes Cora's wrists, and she tries to throw herself off the cliff, while Magua holds on tight. Seeing Uncas arrive, Cora tries to climb up again, but Magua stabs her hands with his dagger, causing her to fall to her death. Magua and Uncas fight, ending up at the bottom of the cliff, where Magua stabs Uncas, who falls, dying, next to Cora's body. Arriving too late, Hawkeye shoots Magua, who falls into a river and is swept over a high waterfall.Cora is buried in a sunlit valley, while Uncas receives an Indian funeral on a ridge. Chief Great Serpent laments \"Woe for the race of red men! In the morning of life I saw the sons of my forefathers, happy and strong -- and before nightfall I have seen the passing of the last of the Mohicans!\""

Buster and the man stumble over each other, and in the process the wallet falls out. Buster picks it up - it contains a large amount of cash. The man realizes the money is missing, and goes back to get his wallet. Buster has lifted the money, and gives the man the wallet. He returns to try and get his money back; gets out of his car, and Buster gets in and drives away.Buster then gets out of the car, where a family is waiting for a moving company to take their possessions. A con artist convinces Buster that the possessions are his and he is being evicted, but will sell the things to Buster. Buster buys them, then buys a horse to take them away.The family, believing Buster to be the moving man, loads their possessions on his cart, and tells him to take them to their new address. Buster, believing he has bought the items, ignores the instructions.He travels down the street in the horse drawn cart, having an encounter with a nasty dog, which leads him to attach a boxing glove on a stick to his cart. The boxing glove knocks down a traffic cop at an intersection -- twice, coming and going.Buster then has several problems with the horse. Meanwhile, the family is wondering what happened to the furniture and other belongings.The film cuts to a police parade in a major city. Buster accidentally finds himself in the middle of the parade, which is being viewed by the mayor and his daughter.\nA bomb-wielding anarchist throws said bomb into Buster's cart. He uses it to light a cigarette and then tosses it away. When the smoke clears, dazed and confused cops are wandering about and chaos reigns.The rest of the film is an extended chase, in which hundreds of police officers chase after Buster and he escapes them in various ways. Stunts include Keaton balancing on a ladder as cops pull it from both sides.As the film closes, Buster manages to corral all of the police into the central police station. He escapes by disguising himself as a policeman. The girl from the start of the film sees him in the police uniform, and once again rejects him. A heartbroken Buster then surrenders to the cops."

Those who sought her hand in marriage would frequently be condemned to death. Her father, the king, wished for her to marry, but he was powerless to control her.One day, the prince of Denmark comes seeking her hand in marriage. He tells her about the wonderful country comes from up north, but she is not persuaded. Since she is in a good mood, she does not have him killed, but simply sends him away.The prince is miserable. He wanders through the woods. A mystical figure decides to help him. He gives the prince a gift of a magic kettle that will show him the way to happiness. By breathing on the kettle, he can see his future. The prince does so and sees an himself in a domestic scene. The mystical figure vanishes, also leaving with the prince another gift, a noisemaker.The prince returns to Illiria and spies the princess dancing with her handmaidens. He attracts her attention with the noisemaker. The princess decides she must have it, but he will not part with it unless she pays the price - a kiss on her lips. She agrees to the deal, giving him a brief kiss and grabbing the noisemaker.The prince makes a bet with his fool that he will sleep that night in the princess's chamber. He then attracts her attention with his second magic object, the kettle. He tells the princess that the kettle will show the one who breaths on it who he or she will marry. The princess wants the magical kettle, too, but the price has gone up. She sends her handmaiden, who is told that he will part with the kettle only if the princess allows him to sleep in her chamber. At first, the princess refuses, but then the handmaiden returns with the key, warning the prince that, if he is caught, the princess will deny knowledge and he will be executed.That night, a messenger from the prince arrives by boat to ask the princess if she has changed her mind. She tells him that she will never allow the prince into her room.The fool, disguised as the prince, arrives at the castle, and is given entry by the king. He comes to the princess's chamber. The kettle shows her that the prince is the one she will marry. Angrily, she tells him that the kettle is wrong. She will execute him but, since a deal is a deal, she will allow him to sleep in the corner of her chamber.The fool informs the king that the prince has schemed to ruin the princess's reputation. Furthermore, he threatens that, if the king does not exile the princess, the prince's army will overrun the country. The king goes to his daughter's chamber and catches her there with whom she thinks is a beggar. Despite her protests, he exiles her with the beggar.They travel to the north, and he brings her to a shabby hut. He tells her she is free to go, but humbled, she decides to stay. Still, she refuses to do any work. She is still a princess. But here, this hut is his kingdom and, reluctantly, she obeys. As time passes, she becomes useful learning how to make pots which they go to sell in the market. On their way, they pass by a man hanging from a tree, a poacher who has been caught by the foresters. They meet a friend of the poacher, who asks the potter to help him. The potter sends the princess to the market by herself to sell the pots, warning her not to break any. On her way to the market, she is accosted by a group of foresters who overturn her cart and smash all the pots. She returns to the hut and shows the potter the cart of broken parts. He is angry. She tries to stop him from leaving by trying to tell him that she loves him, but she cannot quite get the words out. He goes into the woods to poach, and is pursued by the foresters back to the hut. She hides him and, finally, tells him that she loves him. They kiss.They fall upon hard times, and the potter tells his wife to go to the castle to beg for food. The scullery maid gives her food on condition that she make herself useful. The fool announces that the prince has returned, but the foreign princess he was to marry has fallen ill. He asks to find someone who will fit the wedding dress to stand in for the bride. Naturally, the dress fits only the potter's wife. She begs to be allowed to go home to her sick husband, but the prince demands she stay.The fool asks the scullery maid to marry him. She agrees.The prince says that he will marry her instead of the prince. She refuses and begs to home to her husband. He commands that he potter's hut be burned down. She offers her own life in exchange for the man she loves. He relents, but as she goes, he stops her with the same words she used. She realizes that he is the potter. They embrace. Her father, the king, arrives to see the happy couple."

        "sinopsis": "The film opens near the \"last stop on the subway\", a train terminal in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere. A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with the cutout of a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, as if it is he is an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man falls over the cutout. Keaton is thrown out through the window. Keaton offers flowers to his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill).Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that its his own house. Inside, he sees a man and a woman kissing. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, later to realize his mistake. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he treats her coldly. She tries to pick a vase from a shelf, but it drops and knocks her out. Investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton's door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife. As soon as the officer leaves, he drops her on the floor.He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). He quickly dons an elegant white suit and picks flowers (mysteriously growing from the deep snow-a sign remarks \"Keep Off the Grass\"). He attempts to woo her, but she rejects him. Her husband comes back home and Keaton's character has to flee once more.The neighbors leave on a sled for a new, even more bleak northerly location. Keaton gets a \"car\" (a dog sled with an engine) driven by a friend (Joe Roberts) to follow them, but it breaks down, so he has to hail a passing \"taxi\" (a horse drawn sled with upholstery). The taxi is stopped by a traffic warden riding a motorized sled with a propeller for speeding on the snow, but they get away. Keaton is up to his old tricks-he \"reverses\" the propeller so the officer goes backward into a lake. Near the north pole, he and Roberts find a hotel-like igloo with wall-hangings of a stag's head and a guitar. In a gag Keaton tries to hang his hat on a stag head antler but it keeps falling off. They attempt to survive by fishing in the manner of the Eskimos. Keaton makes snow-shoes from guitars and attempts to catch fish using tinned sardines as bait, but just creates trouble he first falls through the ice and then tries to fish but the only things he \"catches\" are another fisherman's baited fish and the other fisherman himself!Forced to flee back to the igloo, where his companion is hoovering the ice floor, Keaton sees his pretty neighbor again in her new hut. Fortified by drinking a bottle of cola, he decides he will force himself on her in the manner of Erich von Stroheim's character from the film Foolish Wives. He appears in Stroheim-like clothing at her hut, but is chased by her husband. Pretending to be a snowman, he eludes him and returns to the hut. Roberts tries to fight the husband but ends up falling into a lake. The husband returns to find his wife weeping on the floor as Keaton stands over her. He wrestles with Keaton. Keaton's wife appears and shoots her husband. The wounded Keaton takes a pistol and tries to shoot the husband, but at that moment a janitor wakes Keaton up in the front row of a film theater (the gun in the last scene turns out to be a folded newspaper in his hand) and Keaton realizes that it was all a dream!"

Hutter travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count, is bitten by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle but not before seeing the Count depart on a cart loaded with coffins. While Hutter recuperates in a hospital after succeeding in his escape, the Count moves into the house across from the Hutters'. The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. The \"Book of the Vampires\" tells Ellen what she must do to end the vampire.The Count meets his doom when Ellen manages to keep him until after cock crow. Best scene is the vampire rising from Ellen's neck after realizing the cock has crowed. As the sun slowly advances on the houses across the street (visible from the window), the Nosferatu attempts to escape. In doing so, he passes the window and is trapped by the sunlight. He 'vaporizes' into a puff of fire on the carpet. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]1922 Version\nThe film presents itself as a chronicle of the Great Death of Wisborg. It begins with a man named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) picking flowers for his wife Ellen (Greta Schroeder) She remarks why have you killed them the beautiful flowers? Hutter hugs his wife, laughing at her reaction. He soon leaves for work, when a passerby tells him Do not hurry, my young friend! Nobody can escape destiny. An inter-title card reveals that Hutters employer is man named Knock (Alexander Granach). He has many rumors surrounding him, the only thing known for certain is that he pays well. Knock is reading in his office a letter covered in strange writing. He calls Hutter into his office and informs him that Count Orlok (Max Schreck) of Transylvania is looking to purchase a house in their small town. He tells Hutter he could make a lot of money though it might require a bit of effort perhaps a bit of blood. Hutter examines a map of Europe while he considers the proposition and Knock takes another look at the letter from the Count. After a moment a thought occurs to Knock, he suggests Hutter sell Orlok the nice deserted house opposite Hutters own home. Knock tells him to travel quickly to the country of ghosts. Both men laugh as the scene fades to black.Hutter rushes home to inform his wife of the exciting news. Ellen is disappointed her husband is leaving, but he is anxious to begin his journey. He packs a few belongings, leaving his wife with friends of the family, a rich shipowner named Harding (Georg H. Schnell) and his sister (Ruth Landshoff). Hutter kisses his wife to reassure her, then leaves for Transylvania. A title card tells us that Hutter travels many dusty roads to the Karpathen mountains. He arrives at a tavern, still excited by his trip. He yells out for dinner before he continues on to Count Orloks castle. Upon hearing this, the crowd in the tavern react with shock and fear. They tell him he cant continue due to the werewolf stalking the forests at night. A wolf like creature scares many horses into bolting into the wilderness, so Hutter stays the night at the inn. After being led to his room, Hutter closes the window and gets ready for bed when he notices a book on his nightstand. It is titled Of Vampires, Terrible Ghosts, Magic, and The Seven Deadly Sins. He reads a section on Nosferatu, terrible creatures that live in caves filled with soil from the fields of Black Death. Thinking nothing of it, Hutter goes to sleep. The next morning Hutter wakes as shepherds are returning horses to their corrals. He again notices the book, but still thinks nothing of it and soon continues his journey.After traveling all day by carriage Hutter is yelling to the driver to hurry before the sun sets. The driver pulls over, telling Hutter he refuses to go any further, no matter Hutter offers to pay him. Undisturbed by the drivers cowardice, Hutter takes his gear and continues on foot. He crosses a small wooden bridge and comes to a deserted road. A moment later a carriage arrives with a sinister looking driver. The driver says nothing, but motions for Hutter to get in. After a cautious moment, Hutter gets in, and the carriage goes back the way it came. They soon arrive at a ruined castle, and the driver motions for Hutter to go inside. Hutter walks toward the castle when the door appears to open by itself. With a bit of apprehension, Hutter enters the castle. He is met by the same sinister figure, now revealed to be Count Orlok. Orlok informs him that he has waited too long, and all the servants have already gone to bed, so he leads Hutter inside himself.A moment later the two men are sitting at a table. Hutter is eating as Orlok studies papers concerning his new real estate. Hutter is watching Orlok so intently that he accidentally cuts his thumb while slicing bread, drawing blood. Orlok reacts immediately, saying the precious blood. Hutter begins to back away in fear, when Orlok proposes the two spend some time together talking, as it is several hours until dawn and Orlok must sleep during the day. Hutter awakens the next morning to find the castle empty but a meal waiting for him. He takes a mirror out of his pocket and examines his neck where he can see two small marks. After breakfast he examines the castle grounds, stopping to write a letter to his wife Ellen. He tells her not to be mad that her love is away, and attributes the marks on his neck to mosquitoes. He flags down a passerby to deliver his letter.That night Hutter is again sitting with Count Orlok. The Count is going over paperwork when he notices portrait of Hutters wife, which instantly catches his attention. He holds the picture remarking she has such a beautiful neck. He then informs Hutter that he will buy the beautiful deserted house opposite his own. Later Hutter is in his room where he is reading more from his book. He reads an article concerning how the Nosferatu hunt and a warning not let their shadow burden your sleep. His bedroom door opens by itself to reveal Orlok who menacingly enters the room. As he does so Ellen begins sleepwalking back in their hometown. She wanders out onto her balcony where she almost falls off. When Orlok finally leaves Hutter, the door again moving on its own behind him, Ellen falls back to sleep.The next morning Hutter decides to investigate the horrors of the castle. He finds a coffin in the basement, and further investigation reveals Orlok sleeping inside. Hutter leaves the basement in a state of horror. That night he looks out his window to see Orlok loading a wagon with several coffins. After stacking the coffins he climbs into the last one, lid lifting onto the coffin by itself before the carriage drives itself away. Hutter, worried about his wife, ties several sheets together in an effort to escape out his window. He falls from his makeshift rope before reaching the bottom, and is knocked unconscious. Orlok continues his journey down the river via raft, the raftsmen unaware of their cargo. Hutter is found by a farmer and is brought to a hospital, where he is slowly recovering. Orlok's coffins arrive at a seaport where they are being loaded onto a ship. The sailors are curious as the contents of the boxes, so the tip over to find nothing but soil and rats.Professor Bulwer (John Gottowt) is presenting a lecture to his class about unusual predators in nature. He shows his class meat-eating plants, remarking how similar they are to vampires. Back in Wisborg, Knock has been admitted to an insane asylum. He attacks his doctor, yelling blood is life! After being subdued, Knock becomes fascinated by the spiders in his cell.Ellen passes the time waiting for her husband sitting on the beach. One day, Harding and his sister bring her the letter Hutter wrote while at the castle. Ellen still longs for her husband, who has recovered enough that he decides to head home. He is still visibly weak, but he cant wait any longer. As he leaves for home Orlok is traveling towards Wisborg via ship. Back in the asylum, Knock steals a newspaper from one of the guards where he reads an article about plague victims in the ports along the Black Sea. All the plague victims have strange marks on their neck, and Knock realizes his master is coming. On the ship sailors are falling ill. The first mate and the captain come to check on their sickened crew, where the ghostly image of Orlok is watching him. Soon only the first mate and captain remain alive. As they heave another body overboard, the first mate decides to finish things once and for all, and takes a hatchet into the cargo hold. He begins to break up the boxes of soil, but as he does the lid lifts off a coffin and Orlok arises. Stricken with fear, the first mate drops his hatchet, runs to the top deck and throws himself overboard. The captain lashes himself to the wheel, but he is soon attacked and killed by Orlok. A title card exclaims the death ship has a new captain.Hutter travels night and day to get home as quickly as possible. In Wisborg, Ellen is again sleepwalking, now speaking in her sleep, seemingly in anticipation of Orloks arrival. She says, I have to go to him he is coming! Knock also seems to sense the arrival of the ship, becoming anxious as Orlok gets closer. The ship docks itself and the door to the cargo hold opens. Orlok immerges, carrying one of his coffins. As Orlok makes his way through town with his coffin, Hutter arrives home where he and his wife greet each other enthusiastically.Back at the dock Harding is investigating the ship, finding the dead captain and a log of the journey. He reads about how illness gradually killed the eight crewman. The captain wrote of a rat infestation and the possibility of a plague threat. Upon reading this, Harding tells everyone to return to their homes and keep their windows and doors closed. Later the town crier announces that plague victims must stay within their homes. White crosses mark the doors of plague victims as coffins are being carried out of several houses.Hutter tells his wife not to read the horrible book he has brought back with him, but some force compels her to read. He tries to comfort her, but they both sense the presence of Orlok watching them from his new home. Hardings sister falls ill, and Ellen watches as a funeral procession is lead by her house. This leads her to read from the book, where she reads that the only way to defeat the Nosferatu is if a sinless maiden gives her blood to it willingly, making it forget about the coming dawn until it is too late.Meanwhile, the fear stricken town is searching for a scapegoat to blame for the plague, and they blame the recently escaped Knock. They chase him throughout the city, but he eludes them, mocking the townspeople from rooftops before running into the woods.Ellen is working on needlepoint, writing Ich Liebe Dich, a German phrase meaning I Love You. That night she can sense Orlok watching her from his building. She opens the window, in a sense inviting him to her. She pretends to fall ill, telling Hutter to go get Bulwer, leaving her alone to face Orlok. Hutter rushes off, leaving Ellen alone in bed. She cowers in bed as the shadow of Orlok creeps ever closer to her, soon enveloping her completely. As Orlok sucks her blood he suddenly hears a rooster crow, and realizes that he has mistakenly stayed out until dawn. He rushes to leave, but as he crosses in front of the window he walks into the beams of the rising sun. He is instantly burned, vanishing in a puff of smoke. Knock, who has finally be captured and returned to the asylum, senses that his master is dead. Ellen is found by Hutter the next morning, the two embracing as the horror is finally over.[synopsis by mvrainey 12/15/09]"

One stormy night in 1810, family patriarch John McKay and his rival James Canfield kill each other. After the tragic death of her husband, John's wife decides her son Willie will not suffer the same fate. She moves to New York to live with her sister, who after the mother's death raises him without telling him of the feud.Twenty years later, Willie receives a letter informing him that his father's estate is now his. His aunt tells him of the feud, but he decides to return to his Southern birthplace anyway to claim his inheritance. On the train ride, he meets a girl, Virginia. They are shy to each other at first, but become acquainted during many train mishaps. At their destination, she is greeted by her father and two brothers; she, it turns out, is a Canfield. Willie innocently asks one of the brothers where the McKay estate is. The brother offers to show him the way, but stops at every shop in search of a pistol to shoot the unsuspecting Willie. By the time he obtains one, Willie has wandered off. Willie is very disappointed to discover the McKay \"estate\" is a rundown home, not the stately mansion he had imagined. Later, however, he encounters Virginia, who invites him to supper.When he arrives, the brothers want to shoot him, but the father refuses to allow it while he is a guest in their mansion. The father refers to this as \"our hospitality\". When Willie overhears a conversation between the brothers, he finally realizes his grave predicament. A parson comes to supper as well. Afterward, the parson prepares to leave, but he finds it is raining furiously. The Canfield patriarch insists the parson stay the night. McKay invites himself to do the same.The next morning, McKay stays inside the house, while the Canfield men wait for his departure. The father catches McKay kissing his daughter. McKay finally manages to leave safely by putting on a woman's dress. However, a chase ensues. He eventually starts down a steep cliff side, but is unable to find a way to the bottom. One Canfield lowers a rope (so he can get a better shot) to which Willie ties himself, but the Canfield falls into the water far below, dragging Willie along. Finally, Willie manages to steal the train locomotive and tender, but the tender derails, dumping him into the river towards the rapids. Virginia spots him and goes after him in a rowboat; she falls into the water and is swept over the edge of the large waterfall. McKay swings trapeze-like on a rope, catching her hands in mid-fall and depositing her safely on a ledge.When it grows dark, the Canfield men decide to continue their murderous search the next day. Returning home, they see Willie and Virginia embracing; Joseph Canfield furiously rushes into the room, gun in hand. He is brought up short by the parson, who asks him if he wishes to kiss the bride. Seeing a hanging \"love thy neighbor\" sampler, the father decides to bless the union and end the feud. The Canfields place their pistols on a table; Willie then divests himself of the many guns he took from their gun cabinet.Source: Wikipedia"

        "sinopsis": "August 1922.Harold Lloyd (the character has the same name as the actor) is behind bars in jail. His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up. The three of them walk toward what looks like a noose. It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the \"noose\" is actually a track side pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier. He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has \"made good\" in the big city. Then he is off.In Los Angeles, Harold gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky and arrogantly self-important head floorwalker, Mr. Stubbs. He shares a rented room with his pal \"Limpy\" Bill, a construction worker.When Harold finishes his shift, he sees an old friend from his hometown who is now a policeman walking the beat. After he leaves, Bill shows up. Bragging to Bill about his supposed influence with the police department, he persuades Bill to knock the policeman backwards over him while the man is using a phone call box. When Bill does so, he knocks over the wrong policeman. To escape, he climbs up the facade of a building. The policeman tries to follow, but cannot get past the first floor; in frustration, he shouts at Bill, \"You'll do time for this! The first time I lay eyes on you again, I'll pinch you!\"Meanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford. She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mother's encouragement, takes a train to join him. In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs. While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the manager's office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store. He remembers Bill's talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the \"12-story Bolton building\", which De Vore's occupies. He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500. The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.When a drunkard shows \"The Law\" (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber. He waits at the starting point despite Harold's frantic efforts to get him to leave. Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there. After Harold starts up, the policeman spots Bill and chases him into the building. Every time Harold tries to switch places with Bill, the policeman appears and chases Bill away. Each time, Bill tells his friend he will meet him on the next floor up. Eventually, Harold reaches the top, despite his troubles with a clock and some hungry pigeons, and kisses his girl."

His manager decides that the doorman is getting too old and infirm to present the image of the hotel, and so demotes him to a less demanding job, of washroom attendant. He tries to conceal his demotion from his friends and family but, to his shame, he is discovered. His friends, thinking he has lied to them all along about his prestigious job, taunt him mercilessly while his family rejects him out of shame. The man, shocked and in incredible grief, returns to the hotel to sleep in the washroom where he works. The only person to be kind towards him is the night watchman, who covers him with his coat as he falls asleep.Following this comes the film's only title card, which says: \"Here our story should really end, for in actual life, the forlorn old man would have little to look forward to but death. The author took pity on him, however, and provided quite an improbable epilogue.\"[2]At the end, the doorman reads in the newspaper that he inherited a fortune from a Mexican millionaire named A. G. Money, a patron who died in his arms in the hotel washroom. Jannings returns to the hotel, where he dines happily with the night watchman who showed him kindness. On their way to the carriage, the doorman gives tips to all the service personnel from the hotel, who quickly line up along his way. In the final scene of the film, when both the doorman and the night watchman are in the carriage, a beggar asks the doorman for some money. The doorman invites the beggar to the carriage and even gives a tip to the new doorman, who is now in charge of bringing the guests inside."

        "summary": "A film projectionist longs to be a detective, and puts his meagre skills to work when he is framed by a rival for stealing his girlfriend's father's pocketwatch.",
        "sinopsis": "Sherlock Jr. starts with a proverb: \"Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both.\" The projectionist/Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton) sits at the back of an empty movie theater with his broom, reading \"How to Be a Detective.\" He has the required equipment: a moustache disguise and a magnifying glass. He is chided by his boss to complete his chores first. So he begins to work, but not before day-dreaming about his love interest, The Girl (Kathryn McGuire). Before sweeping the mess in front of the theater, the projectionist walks to the confectionery next door. There is a box of candies that costs a dollar, and a bigger one that costs three dollars. He only has two dollars. Shrugging, he returns to his work.In front of the theater, a particularly sticky piece of paper sticks to his broom. As he tries to shake it off, he steps on the paper. He tries to shake the paper loose of his foot, but no luck - he grabs it. The paper sticks to his hands, etc. He hears his boss leaving, so he holds the paper on the floor, until his boss steps on it, and relieves him of the problem. We are then introduced to the local Sheik (Ward Crane) - the town shyster. He glances at the candy, but has no money. In the trash pile, the projectionist finds a dollar. He puts on his coat, ready to purchase the three dollar box of candy, until a young woman arrives, searching through the trash for a dollar she lost. The projectionist gives her back the dollar. As he begins to put away his jacket, an elderly woman begins digging through the trash - she has lost a dollar also. The projectionist generously gives her one of his dollars. Finally a hairy giant arrives on the scene. The projectionist offers him a dollar immediately. The giant refuses and begins to dig through the trash, spotting a wallet with a wad of cash. Shrugging, the projectionist takes the crumpled dollar to buy the box of candy.As he walks to the girl's house. He uses a pencil to change the price tag on the box of candy from one dollar to four. He is invited in the house, and presents the gift (and the price tag) to the girl. The Sheik enters and surveys this scene. He takes a watch out of a coat pocket. The projectionist takes out a ring and gives her the tiniest ring - he also gives her his magnifying glass to look at the ring. They awkwardly hold hands. Meanwhile, the Sheik pawns the watch and purchases the three dollar box of candy. The Sheik enters the parlor with the big candy box, and takes the girl to the dining room to examine the candy, closing the curtains behind him.\nWhen the projectionist intrudes in the dining room, the Sheik hands him a banana and directs him back to the parlor. The projectionist peels the banana and leaves the peel on the floor, calling the Sheik back to the parlor. The Sheik stops just short of stepping on it. As the projectionist gets up to call the Sheik back, he slips on his own peel.When the girl's father returns, he discovers that his watch is missing. Not to fear, though, the projectionist has his detectives manual. As he reads the first rule (Search Everyone) the Sheik peers over his shoulder, and slips the pawnbroker receipt into the projectionist's pocket. After searching everyone, the projectionist is searched and kicked out of the house after it is discovered that he has the receipt (to make matters worse, the four dollar payment is the same \"price\" as his box of candy). The girl also returns the engagement ring.As the Sheik exits confidently, the projectionist reads the next step in his detective book, which says, \"Shadow your man closely.\" The projectionist takes this advice quite literally, and trails right behind him, step for step, to a train station. When the Sheik notices he has been followed, the projectionist casually walks into an open refrigerator car. The Sheik locks him in. As the projectionist peeks out of the top of the rail car, the train begins to move. The projectionist runs along the top of the train cars like a treadmill, finally grabbing a water spout, which gently lowers him. But he grabs the valve handle, spilling water all over him as he falls to the ground (it is in this famous scene, where Keaton in real life, breaks his neck). The water interrupts a passing handcar, causing two men pumping it to chase the projectionist. Meanwhile, the girl goes to the pawn shop and the pawn broker points out the Sheik as the man who pawned the watch. The happy girl runs to find her paramour.The projection screens a film called \"Hearts and Pearls.\" He falls asleep at the projector, and his \"double\" from his dream state exits his resting body to watch the film. The main characters of the movie, two aristocrats, turn into the girl and the Sheik.The projectionist in his dream state approaches the screen of the film, and jumps into the picture. As he jumps into the scene, he is confronted by the door of an aristocratic house. As he begins to leave, the scene switches, and the steps of the door change to a short pedestal by a garden wall. The scene changes to busy street, to mountain top, to a jungle of lions, to a desert grave, to a rock in the ocean, to a snowy hilltop, and finally back to the garden wall, forcing the projectionist to adjust to each new environment.The film shifts back to one of the aristocrats (the girl's father) finding that someone has robbed his vault of his pearls. Indeed, it was the Sheik whose co-conspirator is the butler (Erwin Connelly). The father calls Sherlock Jr. (The Projectionist). The nervous Sheik asks the Butler how to foil the the wiles of Sherlock Jr. The Butler has a number of booby traps to destroy Sherlock Jr. He has an exploding billiard ball (number 13) on the pool table. There is also a chair that would have an axe kill the occupant when weight is applied.A gloved hand rings the doorbell, and it is dapper Sherlock Jr. dressed in a top hat, cane, and tails. After he examines the empty vault, he dusts the trick chair, but doesn't sit on it. The Butler sneaks some poison in a shot glass, which Sherlock Jr. almost drinks, but politely hands to the Sheik. The Sheik almost doesn't catch the Butler's frantic pleas not to drink. The Sheik and Sherlock Jr. begin to play pool, and Junior almost knocks the butler into the chair with the end of his pool cue.Sherlock Jr. breaks the rack, and as he begins to play, the Sheik and the butler take cover in the parlor. He has multiple close calls around ball number thirteen, but amazingly remains untouched. When he scratches the cue ball, the Sheik is allowed one more opportunity. The Sheik misses, and Sherlock Jr. aims straight for ball number thirteen, and he... knocks it in the pocket with no effect. The Sheik and the butler are dumbfounded, as Sherlock Jr. puts the cue down and walks away. As the clueless villains try to assess what had just happened (almost swallowing the poison shot, and triggering the seat trap) they discover that the exploding ball has been taken.Sherlock Jr. prepares to tail the Sheik, when we are introduced to Sherlock Jr.'s assistant, Gillette. The detective follows the Sheik to the top of a building, where the Sheik locks him on the roof, and then returns to his convertible, parked next to the tall building. Before the Sheik can drive off, Sherlock Jr. grabs the railroad crossing gate, which conveniently deposits him into the back seat of the Sheik's convertible. The Sheik gets to his hideout, with Sherlock Jr. hiding in the back seat. Gillette had hitched a ride on the back of the Sheik's convertible as well, and gives Sherlock Jr. a gun, and a paper drum full of women's clothing. Sherlock Jr. places the paper drum on the window sill. He is then captured by three of the Sheiks men and interrogated in the cabin. They reveal that the butler has kidnapped the girl, and that the Sheik will marry her. Sherlock Jr. is able to escape, grabbing the pearls and jumping through the window (and the paper drum). He is now dressed in a woman's wardrobe, and as the Sheik's henchmen look around, the detective is nowhere to be seen.One of the men begins to suspect the woman, and makes chase. The thugs trap Sherlock Jr. in an alleyway, but he is able to trick them with the help of Gillette and a trap door. As Sherlock Jr. runs into the street with the henchmen chasing him, a motorcycle courier who turns out to be Gillette pulls alongside him. Sherlock Jr. gets on top of the handlebars, while Gillette drives. The Sheik pulls up in his car, and begin to make chase. A bump knocks Gillette off, leaving Sherlock Jr. on a seemingly possessed motorcycle, oblivious to the fact that no one is driving him.Sherlock Jr.'s bike encounters, ditch diggers, a tug-o-war, a bridge with a gap in it and a collapsing end section, a downed tree dynamited out of the way, and a train, miraculously without breaking stride - that is, until Sherlock Jr. realizes that no one is driving the motorcycle.At the cabin, the butler has sinister schemes for the young girl, until the motorcycle crashes, propelling Sherlock Jr. feet first through a window and into the butler's chest, knocking the wind out of the villain. The Sheik's men arrive at the cabin, but Sherlock Jr. and the girl escape through the window and take the Sheik's car. The Sheik and his henchmen take the butler's car, and begin to fire at Sherlock Jr. The detective takes out the exploding billiard ball, and hurls it into the Sheiks car, which explodes.The four wheel brakes stop Sherlock Jr.'s car before they hit the lake, but the body of the car is not secured to the frame, and it hurtles into the lake like a boat. Sherlock Jr. puts up the convertible top to use as a sail, and returns the pearls to the girl. The car/boat abruptly sinks.The projectionist wakes up from this exciting dream to see the girl in his projection booth. She apologizes for her accusations, and the projectionist watches the movie to see how to close this deal. When the actor in the film takes the actress's hand, the projectionist takes the girl's hand. When the actor in the film gives the actress a ring, the projectionist gives the girl a ring. Then the actor kisses the actress on the lips - the film fades out and fades in to show the actor and actress with twins. This turn of events leaves the projectionist scratching his head, as he wonders how he can replicate the film's end."

        "summary": "A group of oppressed factory workers go on strike in pre-revolutionary Russia.",
        "sinopsis": "STRIKE ![The plot is based on 1903 events at a locomotive factory in Tsarist Russia, but the costumes and technology seen are from the 1920s.]An initial title card has a quote from Lenin: At the factory, all is quiet.The word BUT (in Russian) is added, the text then animates and dissolves into images of machinery in motion.Silhouettes of workers and machinery glide across the screen showing the daily work routine.We see notes and leaflets being posted or passed furtively, and huddles of workers meeting while hiding from suspervisors, in bathrooms and while swimming in the nearby river.The workers are tired of poor wages, long hours, and harsh treatment by their supervisors,.which triggers a restlessness and strike planning among them.A title card reads \"discontent is spreading,\" and next come shots with the stereotypical suited and booted fat director puffing on a cigar.The images illustrate the exploitation of noble hard workers by the lazy cigar-smoking top hatted bourgeoisie.Lower level managers approach a high level police officer with requests for spies, and the officer looks up in files the available spying agents, who have code names of animals according to their appearance and function.A shot of an owl, always watching, thinking and cunning, dissolves into a wild eyed spy.A fox, misleadingly beautiful and sly, dissolves into a handsome con artist.A third spy is similarly compared to a bulldog.In this sequence, docile dancing bears represent the workers.The comment in one of the title frames says the owl-like spy can also see during the day, unlike a real owl, reinforcing the notion that the workers are never safe from the factory owners' spiesThe administration proceeds to employ a number of these secret agents with animal code names to infiltrate and spy on the strikers.A micrometer is stolen, with a value of 25 rubles or 3 weeks of pay.A worker, Yakov, goes to the office to report the theft, but ends up accused of the theft himself.\nThe innocent man is fired, so he hangs himself on the production line and becomes a martyr, trying to escape from the stigma of being a thief, leaving a note behind to his fellow comrades declaring his innocence and including accusations about the ruling class.News of the suicide triggers a work stoppage as word of mouth reaches various parts of the factory.Workers throw down their tools and run out in groups to convince others.The workers leave the milling room running, and resistance is met at the foundry.The strikers throw rocks and loose metal through the foundry windows.Then, locked within the gates of the complex, the crowd confronts the office.As the workers strike one of the ring leaders proclaims \" We have no cowards or traitors among us . We will stand by our demands till the end \" .They force open the gates and seize a manager, carting him off in a wheel barrow, dumping him and a foreman down a hill into the water.The crowd disperses.The strike is decided, and the workers gather in masses to discuss their terms.At first, there's excitement in workers' households and in public places as they develop their demands.Meanwhile, the fat cats upstairs are in uproar that the strike has begun.The next sequence begins with footage of ducklings, kittens, piglets, and geese.A child wakes his father to go to work. With no job to go to, they laugh and frolic.The factory is shown vacant and inactive, with birds moving in.The children act out what their fathers had done, wheelbarrowing a goat in a mob.The director is frustrated by the arrival of orders that cannot be filled.Demands are formulated: an 8 hour work day, fair treatment by the administration, a 30% wage increase, and a 6 hour day for minors, and conveyed to the boss.The shareholders get involved with the director and read the demands.They discuss the demands dismissively while smoking cigars and having drinks.The factory bigwigs are fat men in expensive suits, drinking champagne and smoking cigars all day, laughing at the misfortune of the workers.One of shareholders uses the demand letter to clean his shoe and a spill.A servant uses a squeezer to squash a lemon to collect its juice, to metaphorically represent the pressure the stockholders intend to apply to the strikers.Management rejects all demands and decides to break the strike by any means necessaryMounted police harass the workers as they meet in nearby woods.As the strike drags on, hunger mounts, as does domestic and civic distress.Scenes are shown of a line forming at a store which is closed, and a baby needing food.A fight occurs at a home between a man and a woman, triggered by the want of food, and subsequently she leaves.Another man rummages through his home for goods to sell at a flea market, upsetting his family.As the workers begin to fight amongst themselves, the bosses' tactics become increasingly violent.A letter publicly posted details the administrators' reasons for rejection of the demands.Using a hidden camera in a pocket watch, the spy named \"Owl\" photographs someone taking down the letter.The photos are developed and printed, then transferred to another spy.Management identifies the worker, and arranges for him to be beaten and captured.That night, the director and a woman companion are enjoying a luxurious night out.The pair gets into a chauffeured car, which is intercepted and attacked.A violent small riot ensues, which hardens the ruling class to use greater violence against the strikers.The first scene of the next chapter opens with dead cats dangling from a structure.A character is introduced, \"King\" whose throne consists of a derelict automobile amidst rubbish, and who leads a community that lives in enormous barrels buried with only their top openings above ground.After a deal with a tsarist police agent, \"King\" hires a few provocateurs from his community to set afire and loot a liquor store.Provocateurs are in league with the police and the fire department to blame the problems on the workers.A crowd gathers at the fire, furniture and equipment is removed from the building.A woman runs to press the alarm, but policemen get in the way to delay the response.The crowd leader realizes they are being set up, yells everyone to leave to avoid being provoked but are set upon by the firemen with their hoses regardless.The governor sends in the military, mounted troops.A child walks under the soldiers' horses and his mother goes under to get him and is struck with a whip.Rioting commences, and the crowd is chased off through a series of gates and barriers heading to the forge, then their apartments.The troops on horses pursue the strikers and their women, trapping and concentrating them so as to physically punish them more easily.The mounted soldiers pursue the people up stairs and outdoor passageways, whipping everyone within reach.Children, oblivious to the mayhem around them, are playing.At the climax of the disturbance, a soldier grabs a child, holds it over the balcony for everyone to see, and lets go, sending the toddler to death.A three-second shot of the child's body lying on the hard pavement has a powerful impact.The action is intercut with a laughing police chief while the strikers are being whipped, and later massacred.The final sequence sees pretty much all the strikers shot by the soldiers, cross cut with a sequence of shots of a cow being killed in a slaughterhouse.\n.\nA man cuts along the body of the cow with a long, sharp knife forcing blood and guts out.The cow represents how the factory owners see the workers: as subhuman animals .The next cut shows the laborers on strike being pursued down slopes, and shot to death en masse at the bottom, shown with alternating footage of the dying cow.The last images are of the field strewn with corpses.A title card by way of moral ends the film."

        "sinopsis": "After her studies in Paris, Nancy goes back to her family in Devonshire. Initially she is happy to see her father, mother and twin sister again, but soon she gets tired of her authoritarian father who has hit the bottle. If he forbids Nancy to see her American boyfriend, she had enough of it. At night she sneaks out of the house with a suitcase and goes back to Paris. When her sister finds Nancy's farewell note and tells her parents that Nancy is gone, their father decides to go find Nancy and bring her back.Years later, after the death of Nancy and Georgina's mother, the family's lawyer comes to tell Georgina that her twin sister and father have been missing for so long that they must be presumed dead. The timid Georgina decides to go and search for Nancy and her father herself.\nHer search takes her to Paris. She does not know that her father had come up with the same idea. But he gave up the search for Nancy and now lives the existence of a clochard.After leaving Devonshire, Nancy joined the Bohemians in Paris. She provides for herself by gambling. At one point, both Nancy and Georgina and their father are in the same club, but they don't see each other. From this moment on, the rest of the film is lost.The Derby Daily Telegraph (23/Sep/1924) writes about the rest of the film:\n\"Searching for her vicious sister, Georgina, the good twin, dies, and her soul passes into the body of Nancy, who instantly reforms and takes the place of her sister. Her reformation is the means of the salvation of the man she once loved, and the two find happiness in the Devonshire home of the dead sister, whose living soul still directs the life of her once depraved sister.\""

        "sinopsis": "ACT I: \"Men and Maggots\"In June of 1905, the armored battle ship Potemkin is near Odessa on the Black Sea returning after Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese war.We see many sailors asleep in their gently swaying hammocks. A petty officer walks checking the dormitory. A young sailor sleeps with a shoulder and arm hanging outside his hammock. This inconveniences the movements of the officer, and he reacts by whipping the young man. A few of the other sailors wake up and observe this act.In the morning, the ship's cook has hung large pieces of beef just outside the kitchen. We see ordinary sailors talking to each other, pointing to the meat, and calling others to look.An officer on a railing higher up notices the unusual gathering, and the sailors convey to him that the meat is disgusting.The officer eventually calls the ship's doctor, who goes down to get a close look at the meat. The ship's doctor, whose demeanor is that of a servile sycophant, after looking carefully through his pince-nez, says the meat is not rotten, as it has no worms but only maggots, and those can be washed out with brine.We see preparations to serve a meal on table tops that are swinging because they hang from ropes in the ceiling. Large steel bowls are put on the tables and soup is served as the only food. Some of the sailors do not eat the soup.Later, we see in the kitchen the washing up of dishes after the meal. One of the items washed is a dish that has an inscription around near the border. The inscription reads: Give Us This Day our Daily Bread. The dishwasher holds the dish for a moment, reads it again and shows it, and smashes it. The washing crew abandons the work station.Later, we see many sailors buying cans of food and other provisions at a porthole, evidently a canteen. An officer walks by, glares at the sailors, who stand motionless and glare back. At one point, in talk occurring below decks, sailor Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) says they are being treated worse than the Russians in Japanese POW camps.Other sailors complain about unbearable conditions, of being treated contemptuously by pompous officers and there is talk about doing something about it.ACT II: \"Drama at the Harbour\"Soon after next light, all hands are called on deck. Everyone lines up. Captain Golikov (Vladimir Barsky) comes up from a trap entrance and yells that no disobedience or strike will be tolerated, and he will hang everyone in the ship if he is disobeyed. Sailors look up at the masts and imagine bodies hanging from the horizontals.The Captain then orders all those who ate the borsch made with the meat to step under the cannons in a show of loyalty.Most of the sailors move under the cannons, but a group of about fifteen do not.The captain proceeds to inform those who did not eat the soup that he will kill them. The group tries to go below decks through the captain's trap entrance, but officers push them back. Upon the captain's orders, a tarpaulin is thrown over them, to make it psychologically easier for others to shoot.The ship's Orthodox priest makes an appearance on an upper deck, calling the disobedient to repent, and holding a golden cross high. Under the tarpaulin, some sailors get on their knees.The captain orders a shooting squad of marines to advance and get in position to shoot at the tarpaulin. When the captain finally gives the order to fire, there is hesitation, and the moment is seized by ordinary seaman Vakulinchuk, who intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders.The marines still do not shoot. Everyone looks at each other for a while. Vakulinchuk jumps on the guns and continues to speak. Vakulinchuk implores his shipmates to rise up against those who oppress them, namely the officers of the ship. The captain repeats the order, but it is not followed. Instead, Vakulinchuk persuades the rank and file to riot and turn on the officers.There are dramatic scrambles and running and taking cover and pursuits below deck to grab rifles, but since the rifles are in the hands of the rank and file, there isn't much shooting. The resisting officers are beaten and thrown overboard to drown, including the doctor.The ship's priest, whose appearance is suggestive of Rasputin, gets pushed down a ladder and pretends to be dead.Before being thrown overboard, one of the officers manages to grab a gun, pursues Vakulinchuk and shoots him from the back, hitting the head. Vakulinchuk then manages to put his hand up and touch his head wound, then falls from high into a tackle and writhes for a while before he tumbles down into the water.By then, all the commanding officers are overboard and the ship is under mutineer control. There are shouts to save Vakulinchuk, several sailors jump into the water and get to him, but he is brought on deck already dead.The mutineers feel bonded by their common the struggle, and the motto All for One and its counterpart One for All is shouted around.There is a shot of the doctor's pince-nez hanging delicately from a side rope. It was the pince-nez used as a magnifying glass through which the wriggling maggots had been seen in close up.ACT III: \"A Dead Man Calls for Justice\"The Potemkin sails under the mutineers' control to dock at the port of Odessa. The body of Vakulinchuk is taken to the shore to lie in state, under a tent improvised on the pier, holding a candle and with a sign on his chest reading \"KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP\"First he is looked at by a few curious people. Some old women look and pray briefly. But the word gets around, more and more people come filing past his remains, and little by little enormously long columns of mourners pass by, coming across bridges and down stairways and making long queues on breakwaters..The locals gather in spontaneous groups to talk about the events, and clearly there is seething political ferment against the tsarist régime, although a few voice contempt for the mutineers.As a sneering member of the bourgeoisie heckles a woman protester, the reaction shot of a man turning around shows anger and has an element of threat.During another heated discussion, someone in the crowd on shore says,\"Kill the Jews!\"But the bulk of the citizens of Odessa, after filing past Vakulinchuk, get all whipped up and vow to destroy the oppressors and help the mutineers. There are close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are fed up with the régime.Large numbers of small sail craft approach the battleship to support the crew, bringing food supplies and live fowl in cages and live pigs.ACT IV: \"The Odessa Staircase\"A great many of the townspeople have gathered on the long and wide flights of stairs overlooking the harbor, leading down towards the piers. They are in a good mood and often shouting encouragement towards the ship. Men, women, and children of all ages have come to see what is happening.Without warning, troops in white tunics appear at the top of the stairs, rifles pointing horizontally, and slowly march down the steps. For a few seconds, people scramble away, downwards and to the sides, including a man without legs and another on crutches. Then the soldiers open fire, indiscriminately, against everyone, unarmed men, women, children, and the aged.Dozens and dozens of people scramble downwards and towards the side. Aged people cower behind low walls. The soldiers keep marching down and firing aiming carefully, as they shoot down against the fleeing.A woman carries her dead son's body in her arms, upwards towards the shooters, expecting them to let her pass. She stops a few steps in front of them, says \"My son is very ill\" but a second later she is shot. People look onto the sight, horrified.People stampede over others who have fallen, dead or alive. We see a military boot stepping on the wrist of a child.We see someone wearing glasses with a frightened look, and then the same glasses on the floor broken by a bullet that passed through one lens.The victims include a mother who is pushing a baby in a baby carriage. As she falls to the ground, dying, she leans against the carriage, nudging it away. It rolls down the steps amidst the fleeing crowd. Desperate onlookers watch the seemingly endless journey of the pram rolling down unchecked.Cossacks on horseback then arrive from the pier side, and slaughter the helpless people from the bottom of the stairway with saber cuts.ACT V:\"The Rendez-Vous with a Squadron\"The crew on the Potemkin goes into battle stations, and turns its guns on the town, shooting against buildings where Tsarist soldiers might be concentrated. By then the carnage on the stairs stops, as only soldiers remain standing there.The crew of the Potemkin then puts out to sea to avoid an attack from the shore.A squadron of warships is steaming towards Odessa to retake the Potemkin.The crew on board the Potemkin expects this. They leave many on sentry duty and most others try to sleep. When multiple ships are sighted far away on the horizon, they take up steam and move to meet them on the open sea while everyone who was sleeping wakes and goes to battle stations.As the ships come nearer, the Potemkin is sending light and flag signals calling on the other side's crews to treat them as brothers.The barrels of numerous cannons are ominously leveled towards the outnumbered battleship Potemkin, but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through.The crew of the Potemkin rejoices, and rank and file from the squadron come to the deck rails, waving in friendship and brotherhood as the ships pass traveling in opposite directions."

        "sinopsis": "Harold Lamb (Harold Lloyd), a bright-eyed but naïve young man, enrolls at Tate University. On the train there, he meets Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). They are attracted to each other.Harold decides that the best way to ensure his popularity at school is to emulate his movie idol, The College Hero, down to mimicking a little jig he does before greeting anyone, and taking his nickname, \"Speedy\". However, the College Cad (Brooks Benedict) quickly makes him the butt of an ongoing joke, of which the freshman remains blissfully unaware. Harold thinks he is popular, when in fact he is the laughingstock of the whole school. His only real friend is Peggy, who turns out to be his landlady's daughter. She is described in one of the film's title cards as \"the kind of girl your mother must have been\".One day, Harold tries out for the university football team. The coach (Pat Harmon) is unimpressed, but as Harold has damaged their only practice tackle dummy, the coach uses him in its place. At the end of practice, though, he approves of Harold's enthusiasm (undiminished after repeated tackling). The coach is about to dismiss the freshman when Chet Trask (James Anderson), the captain and star of the team, suggests making him their water boy, while letting him think he has made the squad.Harold is persuaded to host the annual \"Fall Frolic\" dance. His tailor is late making his suit; with the dance well underway, it is barely being held together by basting stitches, but Harold puts it on and hopes for the best. During the party, his clothes start to fall apart, despite the efforts of the tailor (hiding in a side room) to effect repairs. When Harold sees the College Cad being too forward with Peggy, working as a hatcheck girl, Harold knocks him down. The incensed Cad then tells him just what everyone really thinks of him. Peggy advises him to stop putting on an act and be himself.Harold is determined to prove himself by getting into the big championship football game. His chance comes when the other team proves too tough, injuring so many of Tate College's players that the coach runs out of substitutes. Hounded by Harold and warned by the referee that he will forfeit if he cannot come up with another player, the coach reluctantly lets Harold go in. The first few plays are disastrous. Finally, he breaks free and is on his way to winning the game, but, mindful of a referee's prior instruction that he is to stop playing when he hears the whistle, he drops the football just outside the end zone when a non-football whistle sounds. The other team recovers the ball with only a minute left to play. His teammates are disheartened, but Harold rouses them to make a final effort. He chases down the opposing ball carrier, knocks the football loose, scoops it up and runs it all the way back for the winning touchdown as time runs out, which at last earns him the respect and popularity he was after. To top it off, Peggy passes him a note proclaiming her love for him."

        "sinopsis": "It is in the middle of the Gold Rush. A Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) searches the tundra for gold. But he finds more than gold; he finds love, and an uproarious adventure that forever change the lives of the people he meets.The Lone Prospector barges into the only cabin in sight during a blizzard and starts gnawing on an old bone left by occupant Black Larsen (Tom Murray). Larsen tries to eject the LP, but another \"lone prospector,\" Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) also is soon blown into the now-crowded cabin. As the men starve, they cut a deck of cards to see who will go for help and food. Since Larsen draws a deuce of Spades (to the LP's three of spades, and Big Jim's jack of clubs), he must leave, taking his dog with him. In subsequent, unconnected scenes, we see the wanted Larsen gun down two lawmen who recognize him, taking their food and dog team, and discovering McKay's lucky strike claim. Meanwhile, back at the cabin, the starving Big Jim starts to hallucinate that the smaller Lone Prospector is a giant chicken, and eventually attacks him by shotgun and knife. All this, despite the fact that the LP has boiled his right shoe and served Big Jim the \"upper\" (while settling for the nail-ridden sole, himself). Just as things are getting out of hand, a bear barges into the cabin, and the LP presumably shoots it after it has lumbered back out, solving the prospector's hunger issues. Soon they part ways. Big Jim is shown finding Larsen working his gold strike. When Jim remonstrates, Larsen brains him with a shovel and flees, but quickly falls to his death when a snow ledge breaks off into a chasm.Meanwhile, the Lone Prospector has stumbled into a town and sold his pick and ax, but still sports just one shoe (with his right foot swaddled in cloth). He enters the local \"Monte Carlo\" dance hall, and is smitten with one of the dance hall girls, Georgia, who herself is being pursued by \"ladies' man\" Jack Cameron. The LP finds a souvenir photo torn by Jack and discarded on the floor by Georgia, and conceals it in his clothing. Meanwhile, Georgia does not like Jack's raucous behavior, so she dances with the Lone Prospector to spite Jack. After this dance, Jacks accosts Georgia, who flees to a dressing room. When the LP prevents Jack from following, the bigger man blinds the LP by pulling his derby down over his eyes. While the LP is temporarily sightless, a hanging clock falls to cold-cock Jack, and the LP leaves the dance hall, thinking he's won the fight. The next morning, an again hungry Lone Prospector bamboozles cabin-owning prospector Hank Curtis (Henry Bergman) into feeding him coffee and beans. Soon Curtis appoints the LP to be his cabin-sitter as Curtis and his partner return to their own claim. Shortly thereafter, Georgia and three friends have a snowball fight outside the front door of this cabin (which is within earshot of the dance hall), which ends with the LP getting hit in the face with a snowball as he opens his front door. The quartet of dance hall girls come in for a minute, and while the LP goes for more firewood, Georgia discovers the torn picture of herself under his pillow. Upon his return, one of Georgia's colleagues gives the LP an inadvertent \"hot-foot\" by discarding a match on his right foot after lighting a cigarette. When the fire is extinguished, the LP invites the girls to come back and Georgia promises they will return at 8 p.m. New Years' Eve. A deliriously-happy LP has a pillow fight with himself in the midst of a gymnastics routine after the quartet leaves, so Georgia finds him looking like a giant chicken for real when she comes back a moment later for her forgotten gloves. In order to get money for his upcoming party, the LP shovels the same pile of snow in front of several town businesses, demanding a higher shovel-out fee from each successive business owner.New Year's Eve comes, and the Lone Prospector has his cabin decorated, with the table set for five, and party hats plus wrapped presents at the places reserved for his four female guests. He imagines being asked for a speech, to which he instead responds with the (now-famous) \"roll dance\" (in which he pretends two rolls skewered with forks are little legs and feet dancing on the table in front of himself). Meanwhile, back at the dance hall, the clock strikes midnight, the Lone Prospector is long-forgotten, Georgia fires a few pistol shots into the ceiling, and a mob of prospectors and dance hall girls sing \"Auld Lang Syne\" before breaking out to dance to \"Turkey in the Straw.\" The commotion wakens the heart-broken LP, who wanders down toward the noise. Meanwhile, the dance hall girls finally remember their \"date\" with the LP, and the quartet walks up to the cabin with Jack, who plans to scare his former rival. Finding the cabin empty, Jack forces himself upon Georgia, who slaps him in the face. Back at the dance hall, Georgia writes a note of apology to Jack, saying she loves him, and sends it down from her balcony to Jack on the main floor via messenger. The now-dismissive Jack spies the Lone Prospector in the crowd, and tells a barman to deliver the note--which lacks the name of an addressee--to the LP. A no-longer crestfallen LP tries to get to Georgia in the balcony, but Big Jim McKay (who has amnesia since Black Larsen brained him with a shovel, preventing him from remembering the location of his \"mountain of gold\"), grabs the Lone Prospector first and says he'll make him a millionaire within a month if the LP can guide him back to the cabin in which they met Black Larsen. The LP races up the balcony to hug a startled Georgia, and then rushes into the next scene, in which he and Jim return to the cabin, better-provisioned than previously. Overnight, another blizzard blows this cabin right to Jim's claim and beyond--half over a cliff. In the morning, Jim and the LP awake to a teeter-totter experience lasting many tense minutes, before the LP is roped out of the cabin by Jim as it's falling into a chasm.The final scene finds Jim and the Lone Prospector as millionaires on a ship departing Alaska. As Jim settles into their suite for a manicure, the LP humors the news media by changing from his swank morning suit into his old mining clothes and shoe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Georgia lurks on the deck below, confined to steerage. A ship's officer tells her to be on the look-out for a stowaway. Just then, a press photographer causes the Lone Prospector to fall backwards, landing at Georgia's feet. Before the LP can say anything to Georgia, who assumes he's the stowaway, the ship's officer returns to apprehend the presumed wrong-doer. Georgia pleads for mercy, digging into her pocket to pay the \"stowaways\" steerage fare. By then the ship's captain and media have arrived in steerage to explain the LP is really a \"multi-millionaire.\" The Lone Prospector tells the ship's steward to prepare room for Georgia in his luxury suite, and as they pose for a press photo on the first-class deck, the LP gives Georgia a lingering kiss. (By now she is presumably his fiancee.) The end."

She banks this money and, by scrimping and saving, hoards most of the money her husband makes. Marcus Schouler, Trina's frustrated former suitor, discovers that McTeague does not have a license to practice dentistry and causes him to lose his business. McTeague can make only a poor living as a laborer, and he and Trina eventually drift to squalid quarters. Trina hoards money compulsively, and McTeague, crazed with the knowledge of the money, kills her and escapes with the gold, fleeing into Death Valley. Marcus goes after him, and the men fight. McTeague kills Marcus but finds himself handcuffed to the dead man. Unable to find the key to free himself, McTeague dies of thirst."

        "sinopsis": "New York, a world within a city, where anything might happen.On the night of June 18th, in the lower east side, St. John's Oprhanage caught fire. Little Timmy Kelly (Jackie Coogan) escapes from an upper floor by tying sheets together and climbing out. The sheets don't reach to the ground, but when they catch fire, they break and he falls the rest of the way and the sheet covers him. Some firemen see him flailing around under the burning sheet and direct the full force of their fire hose on him, knocking him out of the alley and onto the sidewalk.The Father arrives and asks a sister if all the children are safe. She says all but one.Timmy is running amidst all the confusion and approaches a policeman. The cop asks him where he's going in the kimona. Timmy turns and runs with the policeman in pursuit. Timmy gets away and runs into a barn. He spends the night in there with a black horse.Turns out the barn belongs to a local junk dealer named Max Ginsberg (Max Davidson).Max is sitting at a table eating breakfast, with his black horse looking on through a door that connects directly to the barn. Dynamite is the horse's name and he's a worn-out race horse that is now Ginsberg's sole companion.His business taught Max the gentle philosophy of seeing value in everything.The commercial center, where money talks and the world listens.The law office of Richard Scott (William Conklin).A partner asks Scott: \"What do you want done with these Ginsberg papers -- his claim is about outlawed, isn't it?\"Ginsberg is the rightful owner of these patents, but he has never been able to prove it.Scott says, \"Those unscrupulous attorneys, Bernard and Winkler, disappeared, however, I'll make one more effort.\"Timmy spent the night in the back of Ginsberg's junk wagon. He wakes up to find himself in the wagon out on the street. He discovers some old adult sized clothes in the wagon and puts them on.The trousers are way too long, so he gets an idea after seeing a streetcar nearby. He removes the trousers and lays the legs across the tracks, quickly lying down so he can get a correct measurement. The trousers are cut off when the streetcar passes over them.Ginsberg walks out onto the sidewalk from a building accompanied by another man. Ginsberg tells the man that there's no market for empty bottles.They argue a bit and Ginsberg says, \"I'll pay the nickel, but tonight I wouldn't sleep a wink,\" then he takes the items, including the bottles, from the man and pays him.Ginsberg puts the items in his wagon and gets ready to leave. Timmy sees him and hurries to get back onto the wagon. He finds some shoes that more or less fit and puts them on.Ginsberg lights a cigarette and takes the reins and gives them a shake. When the horse takes off, it causes Timmy to fall down and Ginsberg hears that. He stops the horse and climbs back to see what's going on.Ginsberg says to Tim, \"What am I, a sight-seeing bus?\"Ginsberg gets down from the wagon to get around to where Timmy is. Timmy is frightened and jumps down and runs off a ways. Ginsberg shouts at him, then returns to his wagon, accidentally dropping his money purse in the process.Timmy calls out to Ginsberg and runs over and retrieves the purse, then runs after the wagon, past the Burns Brothers Coal Company.Timmy catches the wagon and Ginsberg pulls over and stops. Timmy returns the purse to him. Ginsberg is impressed and says, \"An honest boy in this neighborhood? A nickel you should have,\" and he hands one to Timmy.Timmy refuses the nickel, instead asking Ginsberg for a job. Ginsberg shakes his head no and begins to climb back onto his wagon. Timmy grabs his coat and yanks him back down, pleading with him.Ginsberg says, \"A job you want. You talk like I pay income tax.\"Tim says, \"Maybe I could watch your horse.\"Ginsberg seems taken in by the boy's sincerity, enthusiasm, and innocent look. They shake hands and Ginsberg asks his name.\"Timothy Patrick Alyoisius Michael Kelly.\"\"Oi, it sounds like the roll call for a St. Patrick's parade.\"\"There's two more, but I can't think of 'em.\"The Wall Street District, where they dry clean without gasoline.As Ginsberg and Timmy ride down the street, a man riding in a car with his wife sees them. He knows Ginsberg, but apparently not in a good way. He pulls the shade down and tells his wife not to worry, that Ginsberg didn't see him.They ride on, past the Diamond Cafe. Dynamite, the horse, is wearing a hat that doesn't seem to serve any useful purpose other than to make him look silly.They see Mother Malloy (Lydia Yeamans Titus) sorting apples in front of a store. She's sold so many apples, three doctors went out of business.Ginsberg gives Timmy a coin to go get an apple. Mrs. Malloy takes the coin and gives Timmy an apple. Timmy asks her if she could make two small ones out of the big one, for the same price. She gives him two smaller apples in exchange.She sees Ginsberg and calls out, \"Hello Max, is your rheumatism all over?\"\"All over, every bone in my body aches.\"She laughs and says, \"Shure, and it's a good thing you're not a herring.\"She's asks Timmy what his name is.\"What're ye doin' with Mr. Ginsberg?\"\"I'm his horse watcher.\"\"Shure, you're a fine combination.\"A Jewish man approaches and asks Ginsberg, in Yiddish, \"How's business, without lyin'?\"Ginsberg responds, \"Business is great, and I'm lyin'.\"Timmy asks how to say goodbye in Jewish. Ginsberg tells him, and Timmy says it to the man. The man is surprised and impressed.Misery loves company, and besides, that night Timothy Kelly was looking for a place to sleep.Timothy helps Max move around the room and get comfortable. He says, \"Something tells me that I'm going to be a great help to you, Mr. Ginsberg. Mr. Ginsberg, hot water is very good for rheumatism.\"Timmy fills a hot water bottle and uses a piece of cloth to tie it to Ginsberg's right shin, then puts a blanket over the top of that. \"I'll take good care of you, Mr. Ginsberg.\"Timmy asks if he should light the ceiling lamp and then lights a stick and climbs up on the table so he can reach it. Ginsberg suddenly cries out and jumps up, ripping the hot water bottle from his leg. It was too hot and burning him. That startles Timmy and he loses his balance and falls to the floor.Timmy feels terrible and Ginsberg doesn't seem to be in a forgiving mood, so Timmy grabs his hat and prepares to leave. He lingers, obviously hoping Ginsberg will invite him to stay, but he doesn't. At the door, Timmy sees a newspaper lying on the floor and picks it up. It's in Jewish.He takes it over to Ginsberg and says, \"Here's your Chinese newspaper.\" Ginsberg tells him it's Jewish.Timmy asks Max if he's Jewish. Max says, \"Do I look like an Eskimo?\"Ginsberg looks at the paper and tells Timmy that there's a story in there saying that Timothy Kelly was burned up by the Orphanage fire.Timothy turns to leave and says goodbye to Ginsberg and Dynamite. He tells Ginsberg that Dynamite is a nice horse. Ginsberg tells Timmy that 15 years ago, by the Louisville, Kentucky races, Dynamite won the derby.Timmy looks up at the large derby hat he's wearing, then takes it off and says, \"I wish he'd win one to fit me.\"Timothy opens the front door and it's pouring down rain. Ginsberg's not worried, because he's not going out. Timothy reluctantly turns away again and briefly closes the door as he steps out, but he comes right back in, asking Ginsberg if he might happen to have a raincoat.Ginsberg says he'd have plenty of raincoats if he hadn't been robbed.Timmy shuts the door and comes back in, wanting to know about the robbery.There's a flashback in time, where Ginsberg is laboring at a sewing machine and he tells a supervisor, Mr. Rosenblatt, that his new patent will save time and labor. He pulls out the plans for whatever it is and Rosenblatt agrees that Ginsberg's idea should work and he stands to make a fortune.Ginsberg's next step was to entrust his invention to a couple of lawyers, Bernard and Winkler, who tricked him into signing away the rights to his patent to them. He tells Timmy that he tried for years to make them pay, but now he doesn't even know where they are.Timmy falls asleep as he's listening and Ginsberg appears to be taking a strong liking to the lad as he looks up and taps at his heart.As time passed, these two lonely souls were drawn together by the bond of human love, and Max Ginsberg found himself a partner in his own business.Timmy paints a sign on the side of the wagon that reads: Ginsberg & Kelly and announces to Ginsberg that they are now partners, 50-50.Timmy calls Ginsberg \"Uncle Max\" and begs him to let him go out on his own and see what he can do. He tells Ginsberg that he's watched him buy things and has learned how to do it. He says, \"I can talk with my hands n' everything.\"Timmy asks Ginsberg how much money they have. Ginsberg pulls out his purse and counts four dollars.Timmy hugs Uncle Max, kisses him on the cheek, and pronounces himself a businessman.Ginsberg: \"What makes you think so?\"Timmy holds up the four dollars and says, \"Anybody that could take four dollars away from you must be a business man.\"Timmy then runs out to the stable and struggles to start hooking Dynamite up to his harness.When Alexander the Great started out to conquer the world, he had a great army. Timothy Kelly had four dollars.Ginsberg helps Timmy get the doors open so he and Dynamite can get the wagon out and on the way. Ginsberg says goodbye to his four dollars, but demands Timmy make sure to bring back the wagon and horse.Dynamite's feet had been on cobble stones so long that Fifth Avenue felt like a mattress.Timmy and Dynamite traveled along the street, amongst the cars, tour buses and other horses and carts.Timmy stops in front of a building and goes up and knocks on the door. He tells the maid who answers that he is Mr. Kelly of Ginsberg and Kelly, buying high class junk.The maid calls the woman of the house. She's the same lady who was in the car with the man who recognized Ginsberg and pulled the blind down.Timmy tells her that \"We pay the highest prices of any firm in New York.\"She tells Timothy to wait and turns to go back in the apartment. Timothy calls out to Dynamite, points at the door and says, \"Oats!\" Dynamite nods his head.The woman returns with some items of clothing. Timothy tells her the hat is out of style and sets it aside. He checks out a jacket and tells her the lining is in bad condition and sets it aside. There is another jacket and Timothy sniffs it and wonders if the moths had a wonderful time with it. The last item is a pair of pants that Timothy looks at and says, \"Not so good.\"Timothy then asks how much she wants for the lot. She leaves it to his judgment. Timmy ponders a moment then says, \"They're worth at least fifteen cents.\"She agrees and he pays her fifteen cents. She then offers him the money back, but he refuses, saying, \"No thanks, business is business.\"Timmy sees who he thinks is a girl bouncing a ball and stops and says hello. Turns out it's a little boy named Reginald who takes exception to being mistaken for a girl.Timmy approaches Reginald and tells him he pays real money for rags and bottles. Reginald takes Timothy down into the cellar beneath his home and through a locked door into what appears to be something of a wine cellar. There are numerous bottles stacked on the shelves.Timothy goes into salesman mode and asks Reginald how much per bottle. Reginald says, \"one cent.\" Timothy says he'll take twenty-five cents worth. Reginald cautions Timothy that the bottles are full. Timothy finds no problem with that, saying that they could simply open the bottles and empty them in the nearby sink.The deal is struck, and they go to work.After buying all the junk he could find, except the Battleship Washington, Timothy Kelly was down to his last dollar.As Timmy is loading his wagon with his latest haul, the Father from the orphanage walks past and stops to approach Timmy. He asks him if he's Timmy Kelly. Timmy nods. \"I thought you were lost in the fire. What are you doing here?\"Timmy points to the sign \"Ginsberg & Kelly\" on the wagon. The Father asks where this Mr. Ginsberg is.\"Oh, he's sick, but I'm running the business. He's a very nice man and don't worry, Father, we're church-going people too. Every Saturday he takes me to the Synagogue.\" When the Father scowls at that, Timmy quickly adds, \"But every Sunday I take him to mass.\"\"That's fine, Tim, but I'm afraid I'll have to take you back to the new Home.\"\"Please, Father, he needs me, and you wouldn't want to break up our business.\"\"Not for the world, Timmy, but it's my duty.\"\"But, Father, the Jewish newspaper said I was dead.\"The Father thinks about that a moment, smiles and says, \"Well, Timmy, dead or alive, you'll get along all right. Good luck to you.\"They shake hands and the Father lifts Tim up into the wagon. With a tip of his cap to the Father, Timothy tells Dynamite to giddyap.After a successful day, Timothy Kelly, the \"Rag Man\" finally established himself in the heart of Max Ginsberg as a business man.Timothy returns to the Ginsberg place and starts unpacking his goods. Mrs. Malloy is there visiting with Ginsberg. She asks Max how their little Irish friend is getting along.\"He couldn't be any smarter if he was born in Moscow.\"Timothy is going through one of the jackets he picked up and finds a letter dated August 7, 1910, written on stationary from the Brown Palace Hotel in Denver, CO.It reads:\"Dear Friend Bernard: Again I appeal to you to locate the inventor whose property we took and make a complete settlement with him. I am nearing my journey's end Jim, and it is my dying wish that you restore him to that which is rightfully his. This is my last earthly wish. Good bye, Jim. Signed, Henry Winkler.\"Timmy wads up the letter and tosses it on the floor.Timmy glances over at Dynamite and realizes he needs to feed the horse. He puts some grain into a bucket and prepares to set it in front of Dynamite, but realizes there's a hole in the bucket. He looks around for something to plug the hole with and grabs that crumpled up letter and uses that.Tim then gathers up the few scraps of paper trash that he'd collected and places them on the ground outside the home and lights them on fire.Ginsberg is telling Mrs. Malloy that his heart is full of love for Timmy.Tim comes back inside and sees how Mrs. Malloy is fawning over Max and says to her, \"You like Uncle Max, don't you, Mrs. Malloy?\"\"Sure, her reminds me of my third husband.\"\"Well, why don't you two get married?\"A horrified look passes over Mrs. Malloy's face, and she tells Timmy to mind his own business. \"I'll pick me own cave man\", and she gets up in a huff and leaves the house.Timmy rushes after her, apologizing, but she slams the door and a sign that reads \"Remembrance\" falls on top of his head.Tim starts straightening up things again and Ginsberg calls him over and asks him not to try and be a marriage maker for him. Timmy then explains that he was only reacting to how Mrs. Malloy was touching Ginsberg and making sweet talk.There's a knock at the door, and Timothy answers it, acting like a doorman at a rich man's home. He asks for the name of the gentleman caller.\"Richard L. Scott.\"\"Mr. Scott to see you.\"\"Send him in.\"Scott walks the few steps over to where Ginsberg is lying on his bed.Tim sets a chair next to the bed for Mr. Scott to use. Scott bows to him in thanks.Scott sits and shakes hands with Ginsberg. In response to Timothy's tapping on his shoulder, he turns, and Tim motions to his cap. Scott removes his cap and hands it to Timothy. After giving the hat an appraising once over, Tim tosses it onto a stack of similar hats.\"Who's the kid, Ginsberg?\"\"That's Kelly, my partner, an Irisher.\"\"I think we're on Bernard's trail at last. He's living somewhere in New York under the name of Bishop. His partner, Winkler, seems to have dropped out of sight.\"Max motions Scott to lean forward and tells him, \"For me, I don't care. It's the boy I'm thinkin' of now. For twenty-five cents he bought enough bottles to make a bootlegger independent.\"Scott shakes Ginsberg's hand and gets up and walks over to where Timothy is working with those wine bottles. \"It looks like business is pretty good.\"\"Yes, I bought all of these bottles for twenty-five cents. They were full, but we emptied them.\"Scott takes one of the bottles and smells it, then roars with laughter, telling Ginsberg that's the best joke he ever heard. He congratulates Timmy and asks him where he got the bottles.\"From a nice little boy at 19 Park Avenue.\"\"What was his name?\"Timothy tells him.\"Ye Gods! My boy! My cellar!\" Scott jumps up, grabs a hat and runs out the door. When his driver laughs at his obviously too small hat, he goes back inside and starts going through the pile of hats but can't find the right one, so he just leaves without one.Tim rushes over to the pile of hats and pulls off the correct one, takes it to the door, and tosses it out to Mr. Scott. Scott fumbles it, and it falls onto the street and is promptly flattened by Scott's driver as he pulls away.Ginsberg explains to Timmy that Scott is his lawyer and came to tell him about those men who cheated him. When Max tells Tim that Scott told him Bernard is in New York and calls himself Bishop, and the other fellow, Winkler, had disappeared, Tim starts to think and then suddenly remembers that letter.As Ginsberg is philosophizing about how a clean conscience gathers no moss, Tim goes outside and fingers through the ashes of that paper fire he'd started earlier. He's convinced that he destroyed the evidence and is distraught about it.It dawns on Tim that he might still be able to help and he decides to go back to that house where he got the hat, jackets and trousers and talk to this Mr. Bernard/Bishop.He takes the municipal railway, walks to the home and knocks on the door. Mrs. Bernard (Ethel Wales) answers and welcomes him in. She becomes immediately concerned when Timmy asks to speak with Mr. Bishop and tells him there's no Mr. Bishop there.Timmy thinks a moment and says, \"Maybe his name is Bernard now.\"Mrs. Bernard directs him to the large study where Mr. Bernard (Robert Edeson) is sitting.Timmy introduces himself: \"I'm Kelly, of Ginsberg and Kelly, 62 McDougal Alley. I guess you know Uncle Max. I found a letter in your old coat. It was from your partner, Mr. Winkler, who was sick in Denver, and it told about all the money you owe Max Ginsberg.\"\"Where is the letter?\"\"I burned it up before I knew.\"\"In the eyes of the law, you have no evidence.\"\"But just the same, the money belongs to Uncle Max. Please, you have everything, he has nothing, except me.\"Timothy approaches and leans inward. \"You can't look me straight in the eye, Mr. Bishop.\"Mrs. Bernard is listening at the door, and she's distraught.\"But Uncle Max is poor. He's sick. He needs help.\"Bernard shakes his head no.Timmy turns to go, but then whips back around and says, \"Some day, you'll be sorry, Mr. Bishop\", and he turns and goes, casting one pleading last glance back at Bernard before he disappears.Back at Ginsberg's, Kelly is sad and he approaches the wagon and removes his name from the sign. Max sees him and says, \"Kelly, if you don't like your name, change it to Levinsky.\"Kelly tells Ginsberg that he shouldn't have bragged that he was a businessman.Max says, \"Anybody what can fill a junk wagon with four dollars these days is a businessman.\"\"I'm too little to be a business man. I'm going back where I belong. I tried to help you, but I failed.\"\"Kelly, I love every mistake you make.\"\"Some day when I get big, I'll pay you back.\"Timothy prepares to go, and Max pleads with him, \"Please don't go, Kelly; ain't we fifty-fifty?\"Timothy tells Ginsberg that he'll send the clothes he's wearing back to him from the Home.Ginsberg starts to cry.A car pulls up outside. It's Mr. Bernard. He steps forward as Tim opens the door. Tim and Ginsberg are shocked to see him.Bernard tells Timothy, \"I can look you straight in the eye now.\" Then he looks up and sees Ginsberg.Ginsberg says, \"Bernard, you name changer, you thief. All these years you are rich with my money, you low life.\"\"I came here to make amends. It wasn't you that brought me. It was that boy.\"Ginsberg is livid and raises his arm to strike at Bernard, but he's so small that Bernard can easily prevent that. Timmy rushes forward to intervene, but Ginsberg pushes him away.Timmy is standing near the stall door and suddenly it dawns on him that he might not have destroyed that letter after all. He grabs the feed bucket and removes that piece of wadded up paper, unravels it and sees that it is, in fact, the letter. He nearly rushes forward with it until he hears Bernard say, \"I came to give you two hundred thousand dollars.\"Timmy starts to tear up the letter, but thinks better of it and carefully folds it and puts it in his pocket.\"Tomorrow I'll give you all the money that has been coming to you all these years.\"Timmy taps Bernard on the shoulder, then turns to Ginsberg and says, \"Uncle Max, how about the interest?\"Max smiles and points at Tim, saying \"That's Kelly, my partner.\"Bernard acknowledges the interest due and payable and shakes Tim's hand and gets up to leave.As Tim is telling Max that now he'll have balloon tires put on the wagon, Bernard turns at the door and tells them he'll see them at ten in the morning, \"if nothing happens to me.\"Tim rushes out the door and calls out, \"James,\" then goes up to the driver and whispers, \"Drive carefully, please.\"Back inside, Max is excited and says \"$200,000, oi, I'm a millionaire.\"Tim gets a scared look on his face, then hurries outside to reposition his name on the side of the wagon, so as to re-establish the 50-50 partnership. Only this time, he places his name first, so it reads \"Kelly & Ginsberg.\" Meanwhile Ginsberg is saying, \"I got everything, the world is mine, four cheers. I'll buy a bath tub, I'll have Dynamite's tail bobbed, I'll buy a car load of Matzos, I'll buy a brand new second-hand Ford.\"\"Just a minute, Mr. Ginsberg, don't get so reckless with our money,\" reminding him of their 50-50 arrangement.Max says \"Oi, oi, such a business man.\"He reaches out and says \"Kelly.\" Tim reaches out and says, \"Ginsberg\", and they hug, rear back and break the bed springs.Springtime, the Idle RichAt a country club, two women and a man are dining on the patio. One woman asks the man who those people are.The man turns to look through his monocle and says, \"They're the largest antique dealers in the city.\"It's Max and Timmy, golfing. Max hits one from the tee which looks like he barely connected. Timmy then sets up, when some man behind and to his right yells out \"Fore!\"Tim looks up, scowls and yells, \"I wouldn't give but three ninety eight.\"Ginsberg: \"Still a business man.\"THE END"

        "sinopsis": "The demon Mephisto has a bet with an Archangel that he can corrupt a righteous man's soul and destroy in him what is divine. If he succeeds, the Devil will win dominion over earth.The Devil delivers a plague to the village where Faust, an elderly alchemist, lives. Though he prays to stop the death and starvation, nothing happens. Disheartened, Faust throws his alchemy books in the fire, and then the Bible too. One book opens, showing how to have power and glory by making a pact with the Devil. He goes to a crossroads as described in the book's procedure and conjures up the forces of evil. When Mephisto appears at the roadside, he induces Faust to make a trial, 24-hour bargain with the Devil. Faust will have Mephisto's service till the sand runs out in an hourglass, at which time the Devil will rescind the pact. At first, Faust uses his new power to help the people of the village, but they shun him when they find out that he cannot face a cross. They stone him and he takes shelter in his home.Faust then makes a further deal with Mephisto, who gives Faust back his youth and offers him earthly pleasures and a kingdom, in return for his immortal soul. Mephisto tempts Faust with the vision of a beautiful woman. He then takes him to a wedding feast in Parma, to meet the subject of his vision, an Italian Duchess. Faust departs with her, leaving the Devil to kill her groom. Just as Faust is making love to her the sands run out. He is obliged to seal the deal permanently in order to continue his love-making; he is Mephisto's forever.Faust soon grows weary of debauchery and yearns for \"Home\". Here Faust falls in love with an innocent girl, Gretchen, who is charmed into loving Faust by a golden chain left by the Devil.Faust comes to Gretchen's room. The devil rouses the mother who sees them and drops dead from shock. The devil then incites her soldier brother, Valentin, to run home to catch her lover. Valentin and Faust fight a duel. The Devil intervenes and stabs Valentin in the back. He then goes around town shouting \"murder\". Faust and Mephisto flee on the back of a hellish steed.Valentin condemns Faust for his murder and his sister as a harlot in his dying breath. She is put in the stocks and subjected to jeering. The girl has a child (by Faust) and ends up in the streets. In a blizzard she sees a vision of a warm cradle and lays her child down on the snow, where the child dies. Soldiers find her and she is sent to the stake as a murderess. Faust sees what is happening and demands Mephisto take him there. Faust arrives just as the fire has been started to burn his lover. Faust wishes he had never asked to have his youth back. Mephisto smashes the mirror with Faust's reflection and he loses his youth. He runs through the assembled mob towards Gretchen; and it is as an old man that Faust throws himself onto the fire to be with his beloved.Gretchen recognizes Faust and sees him in her heart as a young man again as the fire consumes them together. Their spirits rise to the heavens. The angel reveals to Mephisto that he has lost the bet because Love has triumphed over all.Source: Wikipedia"

        "sinopsis": "\"When the Devil cannot reach us through the spirit,\nHe creates a beautiful woman to reach us through the flesh.\"\nHermann SudermannWhen they were young children in Germany, Leo von Harden [John Gilbert] and Ulrich von Eltz [Lars Hanson] rowed out to the Isle of Friendship where, in the presence of Ulrich's younger sister Hertha [Barbara Kent], they cut their wrists and vowed to be blood brothers forever. And so they have remained through school and military service, the one always looking out for the other. Even Pastor Voss [George Fawcett] admits that, although he christened them separately, he's never since seen them apart. All that is about to change.Leo and Ulrich are on military furlough and have returned home together where they are greeted at the train station by Leo's mother [ Eugenie Besserer] and Hertha, who is now almost 16 years old. As they are about to gather up their bags and depart from the station, Leo sees a beautiful woman debark from the train and walk to a waiting carriage. When she drops her bouquet of flowers, Leo hurries over to pick it up. Their eyes meet, and it is love at first sight.They meet again that very evening at the ball at Stoltenhof, which marks the opening of the social season. One look at her seated across the ballroom, and Leo leaves Hertha, who saved her first dance for him, standing alone on the dance floor. One dance later, and the lovers retire to the garden terrace. A shared cigarette later, and they are liplocked. Throughout Leo's furlough, they are inseparable. The day before Leo is to return to the military base to serve out his last five months of duty, his world collapses. While languishing in his lover's arms, her husband comes home. The love of Leo's life is Countess Felicitas von Rhaden [Greta Garbo], and Count Rhaden [ Marc McDermott] is not amused.Rhaden challenges Leo to a duel, first warning him that no scandal can come to the Rhaden name, so they stage the duel under the pretext of a dispute during a card game. Ulrich attempts to talk Leo out of the duel, but Leo is adamant. He and Rhaden begin their pacing, two shots are fired, and Rhaden is killed. Following Rhaden's death, the military court \"advises\" Leo to sign up for a five-year stint in Africa, which means being separated from Felicitas. Felicitas promises to wait but is worried about being alone for so long. Who better to console the grieving widow and see to her needs in Leo's absence than Leo's blood brother Ulrich. A last kiss stolen in a park where Leo thinks no one will see him and Felicitas together, and Leo is off for Africa. Unfortunately, someone does see them -- Pastor Voss.Three years pass. Leo gets a letter from Ulrich saying that he has been pardoned through the intervention of His Majesty and that Leo is free to return home. All the long way back from Africa to Germany, Leo can think only of seeing his beloved Felicitas again. He is met at the train station by Ulrich, Felicitas, and another surprise. Felicitas has become Ulrich's wife. Leo is devastated. Not even the happy reunion with his mother and with little Hertha, who is now 18 years old and living with Leo's mother since Ulrich's marriage, can take Felicitas off his mind.Although he refuses to promise Pastor Voss to never again see Felicitas, Leo stays away from her and avoids Ulrich, too, much to Ulrich's dismay. Eventually, after Felicitas and Leo have a heart-to-heart on the Isle of Friendship and Felicitas tells him how he is breaking Ulrich's heart, Leo resumes his friendship with Ulrich. Of course, this includes being around Felicitas, and Pastor Voss finds the three of them paling around together to be sinful. After Voss delivers a firey sermon, to the entire church but obviously directed at Leo and Felicitas, about David's seduction of Uriah's wife , Leo begins to avoid Ulrich and Felicitas again.One day, with Ulrich off in Munich, Felicitas pays Leo a visit at his home. She begs to talk with him, but he refuses to do so where his mother or Hertha might overhear, so they begin walking into town. It is winter, and the snow is freezing Felicitas' feet, which are clad only in high heels. Felicitas forces him to stop at a gardening cottage where a fire is blazing so that she can dry out her shoes. There is no one else in the cottage and, before long, they're in each others' arms, professing their love. Felicitas convinces Leo that the only thing left for them to do is to run away together, so they make plans to leave that very evening.Felicitas goes home to pack, but she is surprised when Ulrich comes home early from Munich. Not only that, but he brings her a present -- an elaborate diamond bracelet. She puts the bracelet on, takes the bracelet off, puts it on again, takes it off again, and finally puts it back on. She orders the maid to return her clothes to her closet and, when Leo arrives to pick her up, Felicitas tells him that she's not brave enough to leave everything that Ulrich has given her and that she's not going to run away with him after all. She intends to stay with Ulrich but wants to continue having Leo as her lover.Leo is both mortified and furious. In his anger, he grabs her by the throat and begins choking her. Suddenly, Ulrich enters the room. His eyes blazing, Ulrich asks what Leo is doing there. Felicitas throws herself at Ulrich's feet and tells him that Leo broke in and, when she refused to go away with him, tried to kill her. Leo upholds her story and tells Ulrich to shoot him where he stands. Although looking as though he'd love to do just that, Ulrich refuses and defers the duel until the next morning when they can meet on the Isle of Friendship.It being the dead of winter, it is not difficult the next morning for Leo and Ulrich to cross the frozen lake to the Isle. Warm and snug in her bed, Felicitas sit stone-faced as Hertha begs and pleads with her to stop the duel. When Hertha realizes that Felicitas has no intention of doing so, she falls on her knees and begins to pray for divine intervention. Felicitas goes ballistic, but Hertha keeps praying. Suddenly, Felicitas' face softens, she embraces Hertha, then throws on her coat and heads for the isle.On the Isle of Friendship, Leo and Ulrich have selected their guns. Pacing through the knee-deep snow, they turn on each other. Ulrich aims, but Leo refuses even to lift his gun arm until Ulrich reminds him that he intends to shoot to kill. Leo then raises his gun but points it haphazardly. Ulrich continues to aim but cannot shoot. Ulrich drops his gun and embraces his blood brother, telling him that all has become clear to him...the duel with Rhaden...Felicitas...and Leo. .Meanwhile, in parallel editing,unknown to either Leo or Ulrich, Felicitas has been hurrying across the ice to the isle when, suddenly, she steps in a patch of thin ice and falls into the frigid water; after their aborted duel their is a cut back to where she fell in and a few bubbles come up, and then nothing is left but her scarf floating on the surface.Alternate Ending: It is summer. Leo and Ulrich have remained friends since Felicitas' death and are in the garden helping Leo's mother wind yarn when Hertha prances by with her suitcases and boards a carriage. She announces that she is moving to Munich and never coming back. As the carriage starts down the road, Leo races after it, pulls Hertha from her seat, and begs her to stay. Hertha smiles demurely.

She is the seventh victim of a serial killer known as \"The Avenger\", who targets young blonde women on Tuesday evenings.That night, Daisy Bunting (June Tripp), a blonde model, is at a fashion show when she and the other showgirls hear the news. The blonde girls are horrified; hiding their hair with dark wigs or hats. Daisy laughs at their fears, and returns home to her parents, Mr and Mrs Bunting, and her policeman sweetheart, Joe (Malcolm Keen); they have been reading about the crime in the newspaper.A handsome young man (Ivor Novello), bearing a strong resemblance to the description of the murderer, arrives at the house and asks about the room for rent. Mrs. Bunting (Marie Ault) shows him the room, which is decorated with portraits of beautiful young blond women. The man is rather secretive, which puzzles Mrs. Bunting. However he willingly pays her a month's rent in advance, and asks only for a little to eat. Mrs. Bunting is surprised to see that the lodger is turning all the portraits around to face the wall -- he politely requests that they be removed. Daisy comes in to remove the portraits, and an attraction begins to form between Daisy and the lodger. The women return downstairs, where they hear the lodger's heavy footsteps as he paces the floor.The relationship between Daisy and the reclusive lodger gradually becomes serious, and Joe, newly assigned to the Avenger case, begins to resent this. The following Tuesday, Mrs. Bunting is awoken late at night by the lodger leaving the house. She attempts to search his room, but a small cabinet is locked tight. In the morning, another blonde girl is found dead, just around the corner.The police observe that the murders are moving towards the Buntings' neighborhood. Mrs. Bunting tells her husband that she believes the lodger is the Avenger, and the two try to prevent Daisy spending time with him. The next Tuesday night, Daisy and the lodger sneak away for a late-night date. Joe tracks them down and confronts them; Daisy breaks up with Joe. Joe begins to piece together the events of the previous weeks, and convinces himself that the lodger is indeed the murdering Avenger.With a warrant in hand, and two fellow officers in tow, Joe returns to search the lodger's room. They find a leather bag containing a gun, a map plotting the location of the Avenger's murders, newspaper clippings about the attacks, and a photograph of a beautiful blonde woman. Joe recognizes this woman as the Avenger's first victim. The lodger is arrested, despite Daisy's protests, but he manages to run off into the night. Daisy goes out and finds him, handcuffed, coat-less, and shivering. He explains that the woman in the photograph was his sister, a beautiful debutante murdered by the Avenger at a dance she had attended; he had vowed to his dying mother that he would bring the killer to justice.Daisy takes the lodger to a pub and gives him brandy to warm him, hiding his handcuffs with a cloak. The locals, suspicious of the pair, pursue them, quickly gathering numbers until they are a veritable lynch mob. The lodger is surrounded and beaten, while Daisy and Joe, who have just heard the news from headquarters that the real Avenger has been caught, try in vain to defend him. When all seems lost, a paperboy interrupts with the news that the real Avenger has been arrested. The mob releases the lodger, who falls into Daisy's waiting arms. Some time later the lodger is shown to have fully recovered from his injuries and he and Daisy are happily living together as a couple.Source: Wikipedia"

        "sinopsis": "(This is the synopsis of the full 150 minute version)PROLOGUEThe film is set in the year 2026, in the extraordinary Gothic skyscrapers of a corporate city-state, the Metropolis of the title. Society has been divided into two rigid groups: one of rich planners or thinkers, who live in luxury on the surface of Earth in the lush skyscrapers; the other of workers, who live underground, toiling to sustain the lives of the privileged up above. Entire shifts of employees are walking into large factories on a daily basis, relieving a batch of severely overworked colleagues who are brought down to the workers' city in large elevators.The sons of the privileged rich families spend much of their leisure time in the Garden of Sons, an exclusive pleasure garden where their every need is tended to. Freder Fredersen (Gustav Fröhlich), the son of city master Johann 'Joh' Fredersen (Alfred Abel), is being presented with female consorts, when the beautiful and evangelical figure Maria (Brigitte Helm) enters the garden with a large group of workers' children. She showcases them the lush lifestyle of the rich in contrast to their own poverty, and reminds the children that these are their \"brothers\", before she and the children are dismissed. Freder becomes infatuated with Maria, and follows her down into the working underworld. In the underworld, he experiences firsthand the toiling lifestyle of the workers and the casual attitude of their employers. He observes how an extremely overworked man inadvertently causes an explosion at the \"Heart-Machine\", seeing how the employers bring in new workers to keep the machine running before taking care of the men wounded or killed in the accident. He even starts to hallucinate, seeing the Heart-Machine as the Biblical God Moloch that workers are ritualistically sacrificed to. Shocked at what he sees, he proceeds to his father's office.Joh is conducting his business with his assistant Josaphat (Theodor Loos) when Freder enters, and tells him about the incident. Joh reprimands Josaphat for the incident, but seems more concerned with the fact that he had to hear it from his son rather than his assistant. Freder is appalled by how workers are treated, but his father defends this status quo as normal. Then Grot (Heinrich George), the guardian of the Heart-machine comes in. He shows Joh papers containing an unknown schematic that they keep finding on the person of wounded workers. Again, Joh is dismayed that he has to learn this from someone else and not Josaphat, and proceeds to fire the latter. Freder leaves, and Joh orders his henchman known as the Thin Man (Fritz Rasp) to follow Freder, and send updates on his son's whereabouts.Freder follows the dismissed Josaphat and narrowly saves him from killing himself. He asks for Josaphat's help and receives his home address. Freder gets back to the factory and trades places and clothing with an overworked man called 11811 Georgy (Erwin Biswanger). He gives Georgy Josaphat's address and tells him to go there. The Thin Man has followed Freder to the factory, and does not realize that it is Georgy who has now taken Freder's place. While driving to Josaphat's address in Freder's private car, Georgy is handed an advertisement for the Yoshiwara pleasure district, and proceeds to go there, followed by the Thin Man.Later, Freder's father Joh consults with the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), an old companion and rival. Rotwang lives in an ancient cottage between the skyscrapers, and is in the process of building a robotic gynoid. Rotwang wants to give the robot the appearance of Hel, his former lover who left him for Joh and died giving birth to Freder. Joh has come to Rotwang for information about the papers found on dead workers. At the same time, Freder himself learns that the paper schematic kept by the workers is, in fact, a map to a secret meeting place in the city's catacombs, and he is invited by a colleague to join after shift is over. He follows the workers, as Rotwang informs Joh of the same. Rotwang gives Joh access to the catacombs from his basement. Freder is surprised to find Maria, who has taken up the cause of the workers, as Joh and Rotwang are observing her from a separate cave.Maria gives a passionate sermon where she tells of the Biblical Tower of Babel, a work that was started by man in order to get to the heavens, like God. As the story goes, the work was never finished because God gave all the workers a different language, meaning they could no longer talk to each other; but according to Maria, the language problem was simply an allegory for the people being of different social positions, planners and workers who could not effectively communicate and cooperate together. She advises the desperate workers not to start a revolution, and instead wait for the arrival of \"The Mediator\", who, she says, will unite the two halves of society: the \"heart\" that will mediate between the \"mind\" (the rich planners) and the \"hands\" (the poor workers). Freder identifies himself as this Mediator, declaring his love for Maria. She tells him to meet in the cathedral the next day.Rotwang realizes that Joh's son is the Mediator, but purposely doesn't tell him. Joh persuades Rotwang to give the robot Maria's appearance, as he wants to use the robot to tighten his control over the workers. Rotwang complies, but hides his ulterior motives: he knows of Freder's and Maria's love, and wants to use the robot to pit Fredersen against his son in revenge over losing Hel to him. As soon as Joh leaves, Rotwang proceeds to chase Maria and abducts her to his house.INTERMEZZOThe next day, Freder attends a sermon in the cathedral, where he learns of the signs of the Apocalypse. He has a vision in the form of a woman dressed like the whore of Babylon, supported by the images of the seven deadly sins around her, which frighten him. He returns to Josaphat's home, but around the same time, the Thin Man has finally accosted Georgy. He beats him into giving up Josaphat's address, and places Georgy back into the factory. Freder goes to Josaphat's apartment, and since Georgy is not there, he tells Josaphat that he will go in search of Maria. As he leaves, the Thin Man comes and threatens Josaphat.Rotwang finalizes his android design, and gives it the outer appearance of Maria. The real Maria is screaming, which is heard by Freder as he walks past Rotwang's house. He enters but Rotwang manages to trap him inside his basement. He send the fake Maria to Joh's house in Metropolis, and releases Freder, telling him Maria is with his father. Joh instructs the fake Maria to undo all the work that her prototype has done. When Freder arrives home, he finds his father and fake Maria in an embrace, and the shock causes him to go into a delirium. During an extended period full of hallucinations about Maria, the fake one is showcased in the presence of Joh and Rotwang as an exotic dancer in the upper city's Yoshiwara nightclub: her harlot appearance is exactly as in Freder's vision of the Apocalypse, unleashing death and the seven sins as she causes discord among the rich young men of Metropolis, sending them into wild acts of debauchery and murder.END OF INTERMEZZOIn the meanwhile, Freder wakes from his delirium and is informed by Josaphat of what his father's spy is doing to Metropolis, setting young men up against each other. Freder finds it impossible to believe this is the same angelic Maria he knows. The Thin Man reports to Joh, who instructs him to let the workers do whatever they plan to do, as part of his big plan to let the workers start to revolt, so he can legally use violence to quell their uprising. Rotwang, on the other hand, tells the captive (real) Maria how the fake Maria is central to his plan to deceive Joh Fredersen, leading him to believe that fake Maria is doing his bidding, while the robot is actually loyal to him only.Freder and Josaphat go searching for Maria, descending to the worker's city, where they find Maria claiming their precious Mediator has not come, and encouraging the workers into a full-scale rebellion; Freder calls her out to be a fake, which causes a fight with the other workers. One of them attacks him with a knife, but an escaped Georgy intervenes, sacrificing his life by taking the stab. The workers and fake Maria leave for the elevators in order to destroy the Heart-Machine that keeps them enslaved. However, in their zeal, they forget about their children who are all still in the workers' quarters.Joh Fredersen is eavesdropping on Rotwang and real Maria, learning that Rotwang is deceiving him, planning to have the factory destroyed and Freder killed. Joh fights with Rotwang and beats him unconscious before leaving, setting Maria free in the process.The angry mob of workers manage to break into the power station of the city. In a final attempt, Grot, the foreman of the Heart-Machine, closes a set of giant doors to stop them. Joh returns to his office, getting the message from Grot that thousands of angry workers have broken in. Still thinking he can use this to his advantage, Joh orders Grot to open the doors, over protests that the Heart-Machine keeps water out of the city. Workers and the fake Maria pour into the Heart-Machine and manage to get it to stop working, over Grot's protests. As the machine is destroyed, the city's reservoirs start to overflow, flooding the workers' underground city and seemingly drowning the children left behind in the riot. The Thin Man informs Joh that Freder is among the workers, telling him that he will be responsible for thousands of deaths, including his own son.Freder and Josaphat finally find the real Maria, and together they arrive in time to sound the alarm. They rally the children and manage to heroically evacuate them to safety above, taking them to the Garden of Sons.When the workers have finally come to their senses, Grot gets them to realize the damage they have done, and that their children are lost. In anger, they attack the upper city, while fake Maria tells the rich people in Yoshiwara to go to the streets and watch the workers destroy themselves. Rotwang, in the meanwhile, wakes up, now completely insane and setting out to retrieve his robot in order to re-shape her as his lost lover Hel.Under the leadership of Grot, the workers start looking for the human Maria, whom they hold responsible for their riot and their children's death. They find her and give chase, despite her attempts to inform them of the fake Maria. As they break into the city's entertainment district, they run into the Yoshiwara crowd and inadvertently capture the robot Maria, while the human Maria manages to escape in the cathedral. The workers burn the captured Maria at the stake. Meanwhile, the human Maria is now chased by Rotwang along the battlements of the city's cathedral. Freder despairs when he sees Maria at the stake, but then he and the workers realize that she is in fact a robot. He sees Rotwang chasing the real Maria on the cathedral, and chases after them.While Josaphat informs a relieved Grot and the workers that their children are safe, Joh Fredersen watches in terror as his son struggles with Rotwang on the cathedral's roof. Freder finally gets the upper hand, and Rotwang falls to his death.Maria and Freder return to the street, where Freder unites Fredersen and Grot, fulfilling his role as the \"Mediator\". The final text states:\nTHE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"

        "sinopsis": "It is spring in Paris. Elena (Greta Garbo) is in attendance at a masked ball when the Marquis de Fontenoy (Marc McDermott) asks her a question. Elena replies that she doesn't love him and never will, and she then runs from him. Making her way through the crowd of boisterous revelers, Elena goes out to the garden where she encounters the Argentine engineer, Manuel Robledo (Antonio Moreno). They remove their masks and fall immediately in love. They pledge themselves to each other, Robledo gives Elena a ruby ring, and she denies belonging to another man. Unfortunately, it's a lie. Elena is actually married to Robledo's old friend, the Marquis de Torre Bianca (Armand Kaliz), as Robledo finds out the next night when he drops by for a visit.Robledo, Elena, and the Marquis attend a large dinner party thrown by Fontenoy. As they begin a round of toasts, Fontenoy picks up his glass and toasts Elena, whom he calls \"the Temptress\", \"who asks for nothing -- but takes all a man can give -- and more!\" As Robledo looks on in distaste, Fontenoy blames Elena for his financial ruin and pulls the jewels from her neck, claiming that he gave them to her. He then promptly keels over dead from the poison he put in his own drink. Even though he approved of Fontenoy's gifts, the Marquis is now extremely upset with Elena for disgracing his name. When he complains about not being able to pay his \"debts of honor\" now that Fontenoy's cash flow is cut off, Elena empties her jewelry box in his lap.Totally disillusioned by Elena, Robledo returns to his home in the Argentine, where the entire village welcomes him back, including his four best friends -- Canterac (Lionel Barrymore), Pirovani (Robert Anderson), Timoteo (Francis McDonald), and Rojas (Hector V. Sarno) -- and the sweet and demure Senorita Celinda (Virginia Brown Faire). Robledo throws himself into the work of constructing a dam, made difficult because the sinister bandit, Manos Duras (Roy D'Arcy), keeps stealing his horses and enticing his workers away. Still, the work progresses steadily until, one day, the Marquis de Torre Bianca shows up looking for work. Of course, he brings his wife, Elena, with him, since it was Elena who actually financed the trip with her jewels. Robledo is not pleased that she is there, but he offers to let them stay at his house.Elena, in her high heels, nylons, sultry eyes, French cloche, and fashionable European clothes, far outshines the local girls with their bare feet, peasant garb, and pigtails. In no time, Elena becomes the center of every man's attention, including Robledo's friends and the not-so-friendly Manos Duras, who comes with his band of caballeros to serenade Elena and to steal a kiss. When Robledo balks, Duras challenges him to a duel using Argentine whips. The confrontation is brutal, with Duras, a master of the whip, trying to put out Robledo's eyes. As Elena watches the two men, bare-chested, sweaty, and dripping in blood while fighting for her, she is certain that Robledo is still in love with her. In the end, Robledo bests Duras. As Elena lovingly dresses Robledo's wounds, he pushes her away and denies that he fought for her, insisting it was for mastery of the estate.Suddenly, a shot is heard from outside the window. Duras has made an attempt on Robledo's life, but his bullet hits the Marquis instead. Now that Elena is a widow, the men begin vying for her, buying her presents, throwing fiestas in her honor, neglecting their work, even forgetting their own wives and children. Concerned over her disruptive influence, Robledo purchases a ticket for Elena on the next boat back to Paris. Elena tries to convince him to go with her, but Robledo refuses.On the night before Elena is to sail for Europe, Canterac, forgetting the wife waiting for him in Paris, throws a fiesta for Elena, luring half of the work force to make merry with him. When Canterac takes a few moments alone with Elena to sip champagne and express his love for her, Pirovani surprises them by showing up just as Canterac steals a kiss. A fight breaks out, and Canterac ends up running his military sword through Pirovani. In horror, Elena runs off. Robledo advises Canterac to go away ASAP and goes off to find Elena. In a tirade, Robledo blames Elena for causing Fontenoy's ruin, for the death of her husband, and now for the death of Pirovani. Elena tries to explain that those things happened because of the men's desire for her body and for their own happiness, not for hers. Once again, she tries to convince Robledo that her love for him is genuine, but he scoffs.Suddenly, a loud explosion is heard. Manos Duras has seized the opportunity to blow up the dam. In the villagers' haste to build a barricade and keep the dam from flooding, Elena is forgotten for the moment. She returns to her room, where she finds a note attached to her door with a dagger. It is from Duras. \"My songs could not touch your heart -- perhaps a symphony in dynamite will be more to your taste.\"It begins to rain, and the barricade breaks, almost carrying Robledo away in the rushing waters. Robledo returns to his house, mad as a hornet and swearing to never allow Elena to ruin another man. He tries to choke her, fully intending to kill her, but finds that he cannot. He winds up kissing her instead. Realizing that he is still in love with Elena, Robledo collapses in her arms and promises to go anywhere with her. Not wanting to see Robledo discontinue his work or to be the cause of his destruction, Elena slips out of the house while Robledo sleeps and returns to Paris.Six years pass. Robledo has rebuilt the dam and decided to visit Paris again, this time with his fiancee...sweet Celinda. As the two of them get into a taxi, Robledo notices Elena, tired, haggard, disheveled, drunk, and watching him. Robledo sends Celinda on and follows Elena to a sidewalk cafe. He approaches her and calls her by name, but she denies knowing him, replying only, \"I meet so many men.\" When he asks if there's anything he can do for her, she asks him to buy her a drink and refuses his offers of help. Robledo slips some money into her handbag and walks away. Looking across the cafe, Elena sees a bearded man who suddenly seems to transform into a haloed Jesus. From a little pouch she keeps close to her heart, Elena removes the ruby ring and gives it to him.Alternate Ending: Six years pass. Robledo has rebuilt the dam and is being honored for his work. As he looks out over the gathered crowd, he sees Elena, beautiful as ever. In his speech, he thanks her for being the woman who provided him with the inspiration and courage that led to his success. He then leaves the dais and takes Elena into his arms. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

She attempts to seduce him and take more money, but he throws her to the ground as he leaves, and she picks up a gun and shoots him, all while the player piano continues to play a jaunty tune. She calls Amos and asks him for help. Amos recognizes the man from the store, but tells the police that he killed the man in self defense. The district attorney tricks Roxie into a confession, and she's put in jail.The press coverage goes to Roxie's head, and she lords it over the other women in jail. Amos consults with Billy Flynn, the best lawyer in Chicago, but the extravagant up-front fee is more than he can raise. While giving a down payment, Amos notices Flynn's hidden safe. He breaks in and steals the contents of the safe, and although he isn't recognized, he loses his watch in a fight with Flynn's body guard. The next day Amos pays Flynn the balance with some of the stolen money, but when Flynn notices he doesn't have a watch, he suspects but can't prove the identity of the burglar. Flynn and Roxie concoct a false innocent persona for the court-room, but the all-male jury is swayed as much by Roxie's fine legs as by any legal argument, and Roxie is acquitted. Outside the court-house, another murder occurs, and all attention goes to the new celebrity murderess. Back at the apartment, Flynn's detectives come looking for the rest of the money, and ask Amos to show them his watch to prove his innocence in the burglary. Katie, the cleaning girl, produces her watch, pretending to have borrowed it from Amos, and after the detectives leave, she gives him the money, which she hid from the detectives. Roxie tries to get the money, but Amos, in anger, throws it on the fire and sends Roxie out into the rain -- still loving her, and having saved her life, he knows she's a cheat and never wants to see her again. He breaks all of her things in the apartment, but Katie, coming in to straighten things up, indicates a better romance for Amos in the future."

        "summary": "After being rejected by the Confederate military, not realizing it was due to his crucial civilian role, an engineer must single-handedly recapture his beloved locomotive after it is seized by Union spies and return it through enemy lines.",
        "sinopsis": "The Western & Atlantic Flyer \"speeds into Marietta, Georgia in the Spring of 1861,\" pulled by the locomotive \"General.\" The engineer, Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) gets down to oil around, and is observed by two admiring boys. He has two loves: his engine and his girl. The two boys follow him when he goes to call on Annabelle (Marion Mack). They follow him right into her house, and he has to trick them to get them to leave. He presents Annabelle with a portrait of himself in front of his engine. Annabelle's brother (Frank Barnes) arrives with the news that war has broken out. He and their father (Charles Smith) go to enlist. Annabelle expects Johnnie to enlist, so he says goodbye. She gives him a kiss, and he backs off the edge of the porch.Johnnie runs by a shortcut and vaults a counter to be first in line. He doesn't hear that he is \"more valuable to the South as an engineer,\" so he doesn't understand why he is rejected. He tries two more times to sign up, but is kicked out the door. Annabelle's father and brother invite him into the line, but he has had enough. They think he is a disgrace, and tell Annabelle he never got in line. He sits dejected on his engine's siderod. Annabelle tells him she won't speak to him until he is in uniform. An engine hostler moves the engine, with Johnnie still sitting on the siderod. He doesn't notice until, on the third revolution, the locomotive is entering the engine-house.One year later, in Chattanooga, Gen. Thatcher (Jim Farley) and his \"chief spy\" Capt. Anderson (Glen Cavender) hatch a plan to take a group of spies to steal a train at Big Shanty and drive it north, burning bridges to cut the supply line to the Confederate army threatening Chattanooga.At Marietta, Annabelle boards Johnnie's train to visit her wounded father. Johnnie sees her pointedly fuss with her brother's medals. When the train stops at Big Shanty for breakfast, Anderson and his men get off on the side away from the station. Annabelle gets into one of the boxcars to retrieve money from her trunk. The men remove the coupling pin between the boxcars and the coaches, get aboard, and start the engine. They discover Annabelle, and have to take her. Johnnie calls for others to follow him, as he runs after his train, but they soon give up running.The Yankee spies tie up Annabelle. They stop to cut the telegraph wires, and back at Big Shanty, the operator notices the line go dead. Johnnie stops at a handcar shed, and only then notices that no one has followed him. But he gets the handcar going. The spies remove a rail and jam stones in the guardrail. Johnnie falls off the handcar, which runs off the track and smashes down an embankment. The \"General\" speeds past Kingston, where the \"Texas\" waits on a siding. Johnnie sees a bicycle, which he leaps on, but it doesn't work well along the rough roadbed. On the \"General,\" Capt. Anderson unpacks a Confederate uniform. Johnnie runs into Kingston and shouts for help. Soldiers pile onto the flatcar behind the \"Texas.\" Johnnie pulls the pin behind the flatcar to leave the rest of the train, but the flatcar is not coupled to the locomotive, and when he speeds away he does not notice the flatcar full of soldiers is left behind.By the time he notices he is alone, Johnnie sees a railroad mortar on a siding. The Yanks have stopped for water and wood. Johnnie is pulling the mortar car. The spies see him, and pull away without shutting off the water, and Johnnie gets an unexpected shower. Capt. Anderson won't stop and fight because he assumes they are outnumbered. They chop through the rear wall of the end boxcar. Back on the mortar car, Johnnie loads one handful (and a bit more) of powder, wadding, and a cannonball into the mortar, aimed to arc over the engine and hit the spies. He lights the fuse, and hurries back over the tender to the engine. The mortar fires, and sends the cannonball in a short arc right into the cab. Johnnie rolls it out of the cab and returns to the mortar. As he prepares another shot, there is a huge explosion beside the track back down the line. This time he puts the whole canister of powder in the gun. In hurrying back to the cab, his foot gets caught in the coupling bar, and dislodges it. When he finally gets his foot unstuck, the bar falls down and bangs against the crossties. The jostling makes the mortar lower until it points right at Johnnie, who has now got his foot caught in a loop of chain. He gets free, and scrambles all the way to the cowcatcher. The two trains enter an S-curve, and are at just the right places when the mortar fires that the shot misses the \"Texas\" and explodes just behind the spies.The Yanks release the rear boxcar to leave it in Johnnie's way. He pushes it onto a passing siding and proceeds. Busy feeding the fire, he doesn't notice that the boxcar continues to roll to the end of the siding and back onto the main track. He can't figure out how the boxcar got in front of him again. From the remaining boxcar the Yanks drop timbers across the rails. Johnnie, looking for a cloth to handle a leaky valve, doesn't see when the boxcar hits one of the timbers and is derailed out of the way. He can't figure out why the boxcar is now gone.Now he can see the timbers on the track. He slows the engine, and runs ahead to lift the first one. But he stumbles, and falls back onto the moving cowcatcher, holding the timber. With adroit timing, he uses it to hit the next one out of the way.The Yanks throw a switch to a spur track, and lift Annabelle over the tender to the engine cab. Johnnie, occupied with firewood again, sees just in time to stop before the end of the spur track. He backs out of the siding, and starts the engine forward, but the wheels slip. He gets down to throw dirt onto the rails. He doesn't notice when the wheels get a grip and the engine pulls away. He has to run to jump on the back of the tender.The Yanks have started a fire in the remaining boxcar, and they leave it in a covered bridge. Johnnie arrives in time to push it out. But there is so much smoke in the cab that he retreats to the tender deck, where he sits on the water hatch, not having noticed the lid is not on. He finally diverts the burning car onto a siding.Johnnie is so busy chopping wood on the tender he does not notice the Confederate army retreating. The Union army now passes, and Capt. Anderson removes his Confederate uniform. Johnnie finally notices the Union soldiers, and crouches down on the floor of the cab.The \"General\" passes under a trestle, and loops around to stop on the trestle above. When Johnnie passes below, the Yanks drop timbers down on him. Some land on the tender, providing fuel. But Capt. Anderson gets a good look, and says, \"There is only one man on that engine.\" Johnnie stops, and gets off to hide in the woods. It starts to rain.When night falls, Johnnie climbs through the window of a house and takes food from the dining table. When a number of Union officers enter, he hides under it, and hears them planning to get supply trains across the Rock River bridge so the army can attack the Confederates the next day. One officer's cigar burns a hole in the tablecloth, and Johnnie is able to see when Annabelle is brought in and locked in the next room. The officers leave. Johnnie knocks out a sentry with a log and steals his uniform. He knocks out another sentry with his rifle butt, and climbs in the window of Annabelle's room. He gets her through the window, and leads her into the forest. They encounter a bear, and both get stuck in a bear trap. Johnnie keeps losing Annabelle, so he decides they should stay in one place until dawn.The next morning, Johnnie sees his locomotive. He empties a large sack of boots and stuffs Annabelle into the bag. Then he realizes one of his own shoes has come off and he has to find it among all those on the ground. He joins a line of soldiers loading the boxcar behind the \"General.\" He stands where Annabelle can reach to uncouple it from the rest of the train, then puts her into the boxcar as a bag of supplies. He cringes and covers his eyes when he sees a crate and a barrel tossed in after her. He joins the line loading firewood, knocks out the officer in the cab, and starts the engine, heading back south.Johnnie stops outside of town, loops a rope over a telegraph pole, and ties it to the boxcar. When he pulls away, the pole and wire are pulled down, and the telegraph line is cut. He chops the rope, leaving the pole across the track. From the tender, he chops through the front wall of the boxcar, climbs in, and searches for Annabelle. He finds her among all the freight only when he steps on the sack she is in. Then he has to help her get across to the tender.Johnnie stops to throw fence rails onto the tender for firewood, but he has some difficulty getting them to stay there. Meanwhile, the Yanks have given chase with the Texas and another engine. They have to stop to get the telegraph pole out of the way. Annabelle takes what is left of the rope, and ties it across the track between two young pine trees. Johnnie almost leaves without her. When she shows Johnnie what she has done, he demonstrates how ridiculously flimsy it is. But the Yanks are coming, and they scramble into the engine cab and start off. The rope pinions the soldiers riding the \"Texas\" and the two trees are uprooted and get caught up in the siderods. Annabelle's arrangement has succeeded in forcing the pursuers to stop once more.Johnnie knocks out the whole back wall of the boxcar. The Yanks have to stop again to clear it off the track. He slows them down by tossing all the freight onto the track out the open back. In the cab, the Union officer is just regaining consciousness. Johnnie returns just in time, knocks him out with a well-aimed log, and takes his pistol.They stop at a water tank. Johnnie does not notice he has pulled the spout away from the supply pipe. When he opens the valve, Annabelle is knocked down by the deluge. He replaces the spout, and she gets more water over her. They leave, the water still flowing, and it drenches the officers on both the chasing trains.Annabelle feeds the fire. She sees a log with a big hole in it, and rejects it, tossing it out of the cab. Johnnie can't believe it. The Yanks plan to couple to the rear of the boxcar. Annabelle sweeps the cab; Johnnie tosses the broom. Annabelle feeds the fire with kindling; Johnnie picks up a sliver and hands it to her. She tosses it in the firebox. He shakes her, then kisses her.The Yanks catch up, and couple to the rear of the boxcar. At the forward end, Johnnie uncouples it. The Yanks fire at him. They switch the boxcar into a siding, then back out onto the main track. The second train smashes into them, knocking down officers. They just get re-seated when the train starts with a lurch, and they tumble again.Johnnie fastens a chain between the tender and some switch points. He has Annabelle start the engine, and the chain deforms the switch points. But Annabelle cant stop the engine. Johnnie runs downhill to meet her where the track passes below, but she gets the locomotive reversed, and he has to scramble back up the hill. They meet the Yanks at the broken switch, where the two Yank trains end up on an elevated spur track, smashing again, allowing Johnnie and Annabelle to get away.Johnnie sticks the end of a fence rail in the fire. He stops in the middle of the old unstable wooden Rock River bridge of Doom, and piles firewood on the ties behind the tender. Meanwhile, the Yank officers can't figure out how to fix the switch so they can continue the pursuit, and a Union army is approaching the rendezvous at the bridge. Johnnie pours kerosene from the headlamp onto the firewood. Annabelle knocks the burning fence rail off the tender, and Johnnie is trapped on the far side of the fire in the middle of the bridge. He jumps over the fire just as Annabelle moves the engine forward, and Johnnie falls through a gap into the river but luckily they both manage to swim to safety.The Yank officers are still ineptly dealing with the broken switch. Johnnie hails a Confederate picket, and is fired at. Annabelle points out that he is still wearing the Yankee uniform, so he changes. They pull into Marietta, with the whistle blasting, and Johnnie runs to the Division Headquarters to warn them of the attack. The General leads the army out of town, and Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves in the middle of a stampede of traffic. Annabelle sees her wounded father, and Johnnie is left in the deserted street. He finds a sword belt and pistol, straps them on, and follows the army.The Yank officers are still trying to fix the switch. A locomotive engineer pushes his way through them and does a neat, quick fix using an ax. The two engines reach the Rock River bridge at the same time as the Union army arrives. The General (not realising how unstable and burned up the bridge is) says, \"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river.\" The \"Texas\" proceeds onto the bridge to chase them, until suddenly it loses control from the old unstable bridge and plunges down from great height to the reveighn below, and the engine has a big train crash into the lake.The Confederates surprise the Union army, and a fight begins. Johnnie is near an officer, and he imitates his commanding gestures, but his sword keeps coming apart. He stands near a gun battery, where a sharpshooter keeps picking off the artillerymen. Finally Johnnie's broken sword is effective. At his commanding swing, the blade comes off again and spears the sharpshooter. Johnnie tries firing the unmanned cannon. He has to yank the firing lanyard so hard that the gun tilts straight up before firing. He retreats, but the shot lands in the river, blowing a dam. The surge of water catches the Yankee infantry in the river, forcing them to retreat. Johnnie directs the other artillerymen to fire at officers on the remaining train. They retreat, and the whole army retreats. Johnnie directs another shot that derails the last car, stopping the retreating supply train. Johnnie saves a battle flag, and mounts a rock, inadvertently stepping on an officer who was observing from a cleft.The victorious army marches back into town, with Johnnie among those leading. He peels off and sits on the rear of his locomotive. When he goes into the cab, he finds the forgotten Yank officer just waking up. He escorts him to Division Headquarters and hands him over to the General.

But Cyrus's silly friend Monty (William Austin) notices Betty, and she uses him to get closer to Cyrus.When Betty finally gets Cyrus's attention, she convinces him to take her on a date to Coney Island, where he is introduced to the proletarian pleasures of roller coasters and hot dogs and has a wonderful time. At the end of the evening he tries to kiss her. She slaps his face and hurries out of his car and into her flat, but then peeks out her window at him as he is leaving.The next day, meddling welfare workers are trying to take away the baby of Betty's sickly roommate Molly (Priscilla Bonner). To protect her friend, Betty bravely claims that the baby is in fact hers. Unfortunately, this is overheard by Monty, who tells Cyrus. Although he is in love with her, Cyrus offers her an \"arrangement\" that includes everything but marriage. Shocked and humiliated, Betty Lou refuses, quits her job, and resolves to forget Cyrus. When she learns from Monty about Cyrus's misunderstanding, she fumes and vows to teach her former beau a lesson.When Cyrus hosts a yachting excursion, Betty Lou makes Monty take her along, masquerading as \"Miss Van Cortland\". Cyrus at first wants to remove her from the ship, but he cannot long resist Betty Lou's it factor; he eventually corners her and proposes marriage, but she gets him back, by telling him that she'd \"...rather marry his office boy,\" which accomplishes her goal, but breaks her heart. He then learns the truth about the baby and leaves Monty at the yacht's helm to find her. Monty crashes the yacht into a fishing boat, tossing both Betty Lou and Adela into the water. Betty Lou saves Adela, punching her in the face when she panics and threatens to drown them both. At the end of the film, she and Cyrus reconcile on the anchor of the yacht, with the first two letters of the ship's name, Itola, between them.

        "summary": "The son of a Jewish Cantor must defy the traditions of his religious father in order to pursue his dream of becoming a jazz singer.",
        "sinopsis": "Cantor Rabinowitz wants his son to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, \"I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!\" Jakie threatens: \"If you whip me again, I'll run away-and never come back!\" After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, \"My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight - but now I have no son.\" As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.About 10 years later, Jakie has changed his name to the more assimilated Jack Robin. Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage.Jack wows the crowd with his energized rendition. Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer. \"There are lots of jazz singers, but you have a tear in your voice,\" she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical April Follies.Back at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. Jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: \"I never want to see you again - you jazz singer!\" As he leaves, Jack makes a prediction: \"I came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. Some day you'll understand, the same as Mama does.\"Two weeks after Jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before opening night of April Follies on Broadway, Jack's father falls gravely ill. Jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the Kol Nidre for Yom Kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere.That evening, the eve of Yom Kippur, Yudleson tells the Jewish elders, \"For the first time, we have no Cantor on the Day of Atonement.\" Lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, Cantor Rabinowitz tells Sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: \"My son came to me in my dreams-he sang Kol Nidre so beautifully. If he would only sing like that tonight-surely he would be forgiven.\"As Jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and Mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. Sara and Yudleson come to Jack's dressing room to plea for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. Jack is torn. He delivers his blackface performance (\"Mother of Mine, I Still Have You\"), and Sara sees her son onstage for the first time. She has a tearful revelation: \"Here he belongs. If God wanted him in His house, He would have kept him there. He's not my boy anymore-he belongs to the whole world now.\"Afterward, Jack returns to the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: \"My son-I love you.\" Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: \"Were you lying when you said your career came before everything?\" Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: \"I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy.\" His mother tells him, \"Do what is in your heart, Jakie-if you sing and God is not in your voice - your father will know.\" The producer cajoles Jack: \"You're a jazz singer at heart!\"At the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. Jack sings the Kol Nidre in his father's place. His father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: \"Mama, we have our son again.\" The spirit of Jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. Mary has come to listen. She sees how Jack has reconciled the division in his soul: \"a jazz singer-singing to his God.\"\"The season passes-and time heals-the show goes on.\" Jack, as \"The Jazz Singer,\" is now appearing at the Winter Garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called Back Room. In the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside Yudleson. Jack, in blackface, performs the song \"My Mammy\" for her and for the world.Source: Wikipedia"

Sheriff Jim and his big, strong sons Leo and Olin have little respect for the youngest son, Harold, who does not have their muscles.When Jim, Leo and Olin go to an important town meeting to discuss a dam, Harold is left behind. He puts on his father's gun and badge and is mistaken for the sheriff by \"Flash\" Farrell, who runs a traveling medicine show for Mary after the death of her father. Farrell talks Harold into signing a permit to let him, strongman Sandoni and dancer Mary perform. Later, Mary tries to avoid the unwanted attentions of Sandoni and encounters Harold. They are attracted to each other.When Jim finds out that Harold authorized the medicine show, he orders his son to shut down the performance. Harold tries, but Farrell makes a fool of him, then has him tied up. Harold's sworn enemy, Hank Hooper, pelts him and accidentally starts a fire that consumes the medicine show wagon. Harold invites Mary to spend the night in the family home. Jim is asleep, so Harold cannot get his permission; Harold has to use his wits to overcome the opposition of his brothers. However, Mrs. Hooper and her son Hank show up and take Mary with them, as it would not be decent for Mary to spend the night in a house without \"womenfolk\".The next day is a town celebration, where Jim is supposed to turn over to a state official the funds raised by the residents to help build the dam. However, the money is gone. Jim strongly suspects Farrell and Sandoni of being responsible, but Sam Hooper accuses him of the theft and refuses to let him go after them. Jim sends Leo and Olin, but not Harold, after them. When they return empty-handed, Jim allows himself to be tied up. There is talk of lynching.Harold confesses to Mary that he is not the person he pretended to be, but she tells him she has faith in him. Then Hank accuses her of being in on the robbery. Harold fights back when some men grab her, only to have Hank knock him out and set him adrift in a rowboat. He awakens after the boat reaches an abandoned, beached ship. Aboard he finds the real thieves. Sandoni disposes of Farrell after they argue over the division of the loot. Then the strongman spots Harold and chases him all over the ship. Eventually, Harold subdues Sandoni and races back to town with his prisoner and the money to save his father. An impressed Jim tells him, \"Son, you're a real Hickory.\" As Harold and Mary walk away, they encounter Hank. Harold musters the courage to fight his longtime nemesis and beats him up.Source: Wikipedia"

        "summary": "A large-scale view on the events of 1917 in Russia, when the monarchy was overthrown.",
        "sinopsis": "Events in St. Petersburg are shown, beginning from the overthrow of the Romanov monarchy in February of 1917. The soundtrack has no speech but the roar of crowds, sounds of marching, running, trains, guns and other objects enhance the images.In the first sequence, an angry crowd tears down a monumental statue of Tsar Nicholas, symbolizing the fall of the monarchy.In another sequence, important looking people are marching up a spectacular interior stairway at the Winter Palace, on their way to meetings that form a new government. The prime minister of the new government is Kerensky (Vladimir Popov) . He announces that commitments made to allied foreign governments by the Tsar will be honored by the government. Russia's participation in the war continues.From this point, the film depicts the increasingly chaotic days until the victory of the Bolsheviks over the Mensheviks and other small parties that participated in the overthrow of the Tsar.Meantime, there is much suffering at the war front by mismanaged soldiers, and by the proletarians elsewhere in the country, who march in demonstrations to complain that they have no bread to eat.Lenin (Vasili Nikandrov) returns to St. Petersburg from exile in April. Huge crowds meet him at the Finland railway station, and he delivers a speech from the front of a steam engine.Economic conditions and the war continue to deteriorate, and marches on the seat of government get larger and more ominous. Soldiers march back towards the capital from the front, apparently without official orders to do so, and they are welcomed by proletarian crowds.In July, one such huge demonstration is put down by machine gun fire. The central part of the city is isolated by raising of draw bridges. A machine gun regiment opens fire on a march. Incredibly rapid editing back-and-forth between a shot of a gun barrel and the mean look on the gunner's face suggest both the action and the sound of the gun.The massacre and the image of a horse dangling lifelessly from the edge of the draw bridge as it lifts are of unbearable sadness. In this unforgettable cinematic moment, the dead horse and a long haired young woman, killed as she joined in the workers' protest, undergo a slow slip from the deck of an opening draw bridge into the river below.The temporary victory of the Kerensky government is celebrated by the bourgeoisie, depicted as inflated, food and drink-sated fools, their supercilious natures reflected by expressions bordering on the imbecilic.Shots of the monumental Tsarist statues being dismantled are shown in reverse, appearing to get put back together.The film uses a technique named \"intellectual montage\", the editing together of shots of apparently unconnected objects in order to create and encourage intellectual comparisons between them. One notable example occurs as a baroque image of Jesus is compared, through a series of shots, to Hindu deities, Buddha, Aztec gods, and finally a primitive idol in order to suggest the sameness of all religions. The idol is then compared with military regalia to suggest the linking of military patriotism and religious fanaticism.The political parties organize mass meetings at a building known as the Smolny, which later becomes the headquarters of the Bolshevik party alone.The film shuttles back and forth between outside crowd scenes of marches, indoor mass meeting scenes at the Smolny, and scenes of the cabinet ministers in their headquarters at the Winter Palace.Lenin's arrest is ordered. Lenin is, of course, a hero. THE hero. Trotsky is shown as a weak would-be compromiser, actually a mild obstacle to the advance of the Bolsheviks to power.The images often switch from enormous, fluid and raging crowd action, occasionally taken from news film but more often staged with a cast of thousands, to closeups of faces that reflect deep emotion or show the activities of individuals in the groups. The distribution of rifles or the passing out of leaflets is shown in closeups several times.The main heroes are the proletariat, poor but possessed of a fierce and empowering nobility. The Leninist notion that the masses cannot progress without the guidance of the party guides much of the crowd action.By late October, the Kerensky government has lost control, and the Bolsheviks are ready to strike a final blow to achieve total power.The feckless Kerensky, head of the Provisional Government, is pictured in cuts with views statuettes of Napoleon, who was forced to retreat from Russia. Depicted as a coward, Kerensky abandons his cabinet in the Winter palace while he flees in a luxury car bedecked with a small American flag.The government offices are towards the end guarded by two armed groups, one formed by military cadets, and the other by a group of tough women soldiers. They are repeatedly told that military help is on the way. However, a train bringing in the troops under the command of a general is detained by sabotage on the tracks by proletarian militias, and the military on the train make no effort to continue.A small warship enters the city river and posts itself close to the Winter Palace.Extensive use is made of montage that expresses ideas by editing in shots of objects from outside the setting or unrelated to the narrative. For example, images of the Tsar's clockwork toy preening peacock are spliced into a scene in which the provisional government ministers meet.While the government ministers dawdle and vacillate, an advance guard infiltrates the palace, and proletarian agents seek out and talk to small groups of the military defenders inside.The key moments of the revolution are shown to be instances where military groups originally charged with defending the status quo refuse to shoot against proletarian marches or militias and instead join with the protesters or cheer them on.The images often contrast faces with still objects. The workers are juxtaposed with weapons, streets, bridges. The visual setting is spectacular: impressive statues, large exterior views which encompass roads, bridges, canals, masses of people and armies, extended interior views, beautiful decorative objects and art works like Rodin's sculptures.A lengthy all parties congress held at the Smolny, that involves all kinds of comings and goings, eventually votes that it will be the Bolsheviks who will form a new government after the Winter Palace, the headquarters of the remains of the Kerensky cabinet, is overwhelmed. In these sequences, men are shown scrambling in and out of a doorway again and again and again to represent the enormous numbers of delegates that are participating.In these scenes, particularly ugly or bizarre looking actors are cast as people intended to appear ridiculous, such as the Mensheviks and provisional government ministers.The Bolsheviks vote to order their proletarian militias to take over the seat of government. A note giving the military defenders twenty minutes to surrender and quit their posts is passed to the other side by a threesome advancing slowly with white flags of truce.There are tense waiting periods after the ultimatum to the defending units, and all of them quietly cross over and throw down their weapons. After the twenty minutes there follows a breathtaking sequence in the storming of the huge palace.While the red guards are ransacking the Tsars apartments, they have a laugh amongst themselves when pulling a decorative cushion off an ornate chair reveals a commode, while framed photos of the deposed tsar and tsarina seem to be looking on.The rebels eventually enter the room where the cabinet members are, arrest the ministers, and\nAnatov-Oveyenko signs a proclamation dissolving the provisional government.A new government announces decrees of peace and of land in November of 1917."

        "sinopsis": "In the summertime, described as vacation time, a Woman from the city (Margaret Livingston) travels to the country to sight see.She lingers in one particular town for weeks. One day she dresses up, asking the wife of her landlord to shine her high heeled shoes, and wanders through town. She arrives at the house of a farmer, The Man (George O'Brien) and his Wife (Janet Gaynor). The Man is about to sit down to dinner with his wife and notices the woman waiting for him. He seems guilty and nervous but he waves the City Woman to an area beyond the house, changes his coat, and leaves his house. His wife comes out from the kitchen, carrying dinner, and sadly notices that her husband has left. Two townswomen discuss how the young married couple used to be as happy as children. A flashback shows a happy farmer, wife, and child. The two old townswomen discuss how things have changed since the city woman arrived. They discuss how money lenders are stripping the farm while the wife sits alone. Another flashback shows two men leading a cow away as the Man watches. The wife leaves the empty dinner table to cry on her childs pillow.\nThe farmer walks under the moon. He travels deeper into wooded brush, crossing fences and shadows, to meet the Woman from the City. She waits under the moon, fixing her makeup. They meet and kiss. The wife cries alone with her child as the Man embraces the Woman from the City. The Woman from the City says, \"Tell me you are all mine.\" He nods assent. She says, \"Sell your farm and come with me to the city.\" The Man asks, \"And my wife?\" The Woman from the City says, \"Couldn't she get drowned?\" The Man recoils at the thought, and nearly chokes the woman in anger. She kisses his anger away and he calms down. The Woman from the City insists that he come to the city. Images of the city, brass bands and skyscrapers, flash above them. The Woman from the City dances under the moonlight. She concocts a plan to kill the wife in a boat accident. She instructs the Man to use a bundle of reeds to save himself, and the Man slinks home. He slinks into his bedroom, lays on his bed and looks at his sleeping wife. He thinks of the dark water and falls asleep.\nThe Wife watches the Man as he sleeps. She covers him in a blanket and stares at him adoringly. He wakes, sees his bundle of weeds, and remembers his dark purpose. He sees his wife and feels deep remorse. A ghostly image of the Woman from the City caresses him, urging him to commit the murder. He goes to his wife and asks her to accompany him. She responds happily. She leaves her child with a friend, saying that she and her husband are going on a trip across the water. She says goodbye to the child and the family dog. They go to the boat and the farmer stows his bundle of reeds. The dog, tied up at the house, begins to bark wildly, and the Man is disturbed. The dog breaks free and follows them out into the water. It climbs aboard but the Man returns to the shore and takes it back to the house. They disembark again. The Man refuses to look his wife in the eye as he rows. The Wife becomes worried by the crazed look in her eye. The man stops rowing, he looks at his wife, he rises and shuffles ominously toward her. She cowers in fear and raises her hands prayerfully toward him. He loses his urge to kill, falls back to the oars, and rows furiously toward the shore. The boat lands and the Wife immediately runs away. The Man chases her, telling her not to be afraid. The Wife runs to a trolley car and climbs aboard. The man catches the car at the last moment. The car travels through the woods and goes into the city. When the car stops, the Wife bolts into traffic. The Man follows, saying again \"Don't be afraid of me\" The Man catches his wife and leads her into a restaurant. He gets her a plate of cakes and they sit in silence. Neither can look the other in the eye. She takes a cake and breaks down, weeping bitterly. She leaves the restaurant and the Man follows. He buys her flowers and holds her until her fear and sadness pass. They hear church bells and wander into a wedding ceremony. While watching the exchange of vows the Man breaks down. He cries in terrible shame and guilt, realizing how horrible a husband he has been. He cries in his wife's lap, she leads him away from the ceremony. He begs her for forgiveness. The bells sound and they kiss, their vows renewed. They leave the church and wander into the street oblivious to the busy traffic around them. The city scene around them dissolves into a wooded meadow. When the city returns they wake up in the middle of the street with the traffic stopped around them. They move to the sidewalk and embrace in wedded bliss. They look at wedding photos in a shop window. The Wife urges the Man to get a shave. They enter a barber shop. The Man sits for a shave while the Wife waits and watches. She is annoyed to see a manicurist showing her husband attention. The Man shoos her away. He is annoyed to see a waiting male customer showing her attention. After his shave the Man approaches the customer and frightens him with a pocket knife. The couple go to the photographers shop to have their picture taken. While they try to look austere they become humorous with love and teasing. They kiss deeply and the photographer takes the picture. As they wait for their photo they knock over a statue. When the photographer returns they pay for the picture and leave quickly. The Man replaces the statue head with a rubber duck ball, which amuses the photographer when he sees it.\nMeanwhile, the Woman from the City plots selling the farm through a newspaper ad.\nThe couple go to a large pleasure fair/entertainment district. They play carnival games. At one game a baby pig escapes and everyone in the crowd tries to catch it. There are comic antics involved in catching the pig. The Man succeeds in catching the pig and the crowd cheers him. The crowd urges the couple to dance, and a band plays a country song. The man and Wife do a country dance and the crowd cheer. After the dance, the couple are ushered to a table and drink wine in celebration. They are in a bliss of love and wedded union, they visualize angels drifting above their heads. The waiter arrives to give them their bill. They each pay a part of the bill and leave the carnival as fireworks light up the sky. They board the trolley for home. Soon, they are sailing back to the farm under the moonlight. They drift peacefully. They pass a skiff filled with festive people. The Wife falls asleep. A storm begins to rise. The storm blows through the city and the pleasure district. The storm rocks the boat of the Man and Wife. The Man tries desperately to control the boat. Losing hope, the Man straps the reeds to his wife. They cling together as the boat capsizes.\nThe storm passes and the man awakes on the rocks. The Man climbs ashore and calls for his wife.\nThe Woman from the City wakes to the frantic mobilization of the townsfolk. She leaves to witness the search.\nThe Man is maddened in his search for his wife. Boats search the water, calling her name. The Man follows a trail of floating weeds till he is convinced she has drowned. The man goes home in desolated sadness. The Woman from the City goes to his house. She calls him out. He goes to her in a murderous rage for all he has lost. As he begins to choke her he hears the call that his wife has been found alive. He runs home and arrives as she wakes up. They embrace. A fisherman describes how he found her and the townsfolk share their happiness.\nAs the sun rises, the Woman from the City leaves on a cart.\nAs the sun rises, the Man sits by the bed where his wife smiles radiantly at him. They embrace.\nThey dissolve into the sunrise itself.FINIS"

Jack fails to realize that \"the girl next door\", Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Air Service. When they leave for training camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him. She actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack's affection.Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, but their acquaintance is all too brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day. Undaunted, the two men endure a rigorous training period, where they go from being enemies to best friends. Upon graduating, they are shipped off to France to fight the Germans.Mary joins the war effort by becoming an ambulance driver. She later learns of Jack's reputation as the ace known as \"The Shooting Star\" and encounters him while on leave in Paris. She finds him, but he is too drunk to recognize her. She puts him to bed, but when two military police barge in while she is innocently changing from a borrowed dress back into her uniform in the same room, she is forced to resign and return to the United States.The climax of the story comes with the epic Battle of Saint-Mihiel. David is shot down and presumed dead. However, he survives the crash landing, steals a German biplane, and heads for the Allied lines. By a tragic stroke of bad luck, Jack spots the enemy aircraft and, bent on avenging his friend, begins an attack. He is successful in downing the aircraft and lands to retrieve a souvenir of his victory. The owner of the land where David's aircraft crashed urges Jack to come to the dying man's side. He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him and before he dies, forgives his comrade.At the war's end, Jack returns home to a hero's welcome. He visits David's grieving parents to return his friend's effects. During the visit he begs their forgiveness for causing David's death. Mrs. Armstrong says it is not Jack who is responsible for her son's death, but the war. Then, Jack is reunited with Mary and realizes he loves her.Source: Wikipedia"

        "sinopsis": "Pandoras Box leaps into the story of Lulu (Louise Brooks), a vivacious and alluring young woman. Lulu supports herself in a the apartment where we first meet her, funished nicely, including a painting of her as well as a large menorah. In the very first act what at first seems to be a pathetic beggar comes to the door, but it turns out that he's actually her conniving old pimp Schigolch (Carl Goetz) who's got plenty of money - and as the story plays out he helps himself to her money from the many companions she keeps. She is very cozy with him, though perhaps he would prefer more, and she refers to him as her first \"patron\". It is Lulu and her 'patron' who are behind the scenes in this movie. At the start Lulu's lover is the prestigious Dr. Ludwig Schoen (Fritz Kortner). Dr. Schoen comes to break their relationship, already scandalous, as he is engaged to be married to a woman who we soon meet, the minister of the Interior Herr von Zarnikos' daughter Charlotte Marie Adelaide. But Lulu won't be so easily dismissed. This is facilitated by Schigolgh's timely introduction of Lulu her to Rodrigo Quast (Carl Raschig) a variety acrobat that wants to put Lulu in one of his shows, and Lulu frankly admires his muscles.Lulu had become close friends with Dr. Schoen's son Alwa. In a possessive form of jealousy Dr. Schoen advises Alwa not to let Lulu do her trapeze act, but instead to put her in Alwas' revue.At the revue we find everyone glamorously dressed for the lavish dance variety show. There is a hustle and bustle backstage and when Lulu catches a glimpse of Dr. Schoens fiancée Charlotte, Lulu refuses to go on. This frustrates Dr. Schoen and he rushes her into an empty prop room where she plays a temper tantrum as she throws herself onto a bedded area against the prop shelves. She kicks her legs about, pulls and tugs at Dr. Schoen in a teasing manner that causes him to succumb to her after she sexily bites at his finger. They kiss and embrace and then the door opens allowing the director, Alwa and Charlotte to glimpse Dr. Schoens infidelity. This pleases Lulu as she smiles mischievously to everyone. She stands curtly and prances out of the room with a smug sense of satisfaction. She goes on with the performance while they are left to sort out the emotions they all are suffering over Lulu.The events of Dr. Schoens life are traumatically altered as he realizes that he is doomed to be in love with Lulu, which will in some way lead to his downfall. At their wedding reception Lulu is radiant in her white dress and her friends Schigolch and Rodrigo are in attendance. They both get quite intoxicated and Schigolch is determined to place a rose on the brides bed. In doing this it leads to a private party in the bedroom. Dr. Schoen enters the room to find Lulu his wife sitting in the lap of the debauched Schigolch with a Drunken Rodrigo nearby. This is too much for Dr. Schoen to allow. He silently has a mental snap, reaches for his hand gun and points it at Schigolch and Rodrigo but Lulu protests that he cannot shoot Schigologh - he's her father! Schifolch and Rodrigo scramble out of the room and into the continuing party in the adjoining room. Dr. Schoens threatens both Rodrigo and Schigolch by waving the firearm at them through the living room reception party until they exit the party. This shocks the guests and they all decide to leave. While this is going on, his son Alwa declares his love to Lulu and invites her to go with him on his train trip. He cradles his head on her lap and appears in ecstasy as she sits caressing him tenderly. Dr. Schoen goes back to the room and quickly warns his son not to miss his train. After Alwa leaves the room Dr. Schoen deliberately moves towards Lulu with an insane look in his eyes. She realizes he is not of right mind. For the first time she realizes that her behavior has gone too far as he jams the handgun into her delicate hand. He orders her to kill herself. This leads to a struggle which ends in Dr. Schoen being shot in the belly by his own weapon. As he slowly dies Alwa returns and as his father clutches his son in his last breaths he warns Alwa about Lulu and that he will be next.Lulu is charged by the courts and the prosecutor wants the death penalty. During the trial the prosecutor likens Lulu to the Greek Goddess Pandora an expert at flattery who opened the box given to her by the Gods and let evil loose upon the world. While the defense portrays Lulu as innocent, the prosecutor sees her as Pandora, and accuses her of leading Dr. Schoen to his demise. The trial ends up with Lulu getting a minimal prison sentence of five years, however her friends have other plans and they create a ruse by pulling the fire alarm, which provides them the chance to break Lulu free from her captivity.Lulu returns home to the scene of her crime as a fugitive. Alwa returns and wonders how she could feel comfortable in the place his fathers blood was shed. She picks up the phone ready to turn herself in until Alwa takes over the call to stop her from giving her location up. He pretends to the state prosecutor that he has not seen her and Lulu takes this as a sign that she is still in control of his affections. He succumbs to her feminine power, she leaves him under complete control within her arms. She agrees to go with him as they hug romantically.On the ship ride Lulu is greeted by a nefarious gentleman who works behind the scenes to use her vulnerability of having a bounty on her head to sell her to an Egyptian who owns a place in Cairo where discriminating customers will take pleasure in Lulus company. Meanwhile Rodrigo is trying to drum up capital for another show and he tries to strong arm it out of Lulu. In her dismay over his domineering threats, she reverts to Schigolch for help who in his sleazy manner sits her on his lap telling her to cry it all away. Then he has an idea and they use Alwa to cheat at cards in the ships casino. Alwa is ultimately caught at the table and then pandemonium occurs as they try and get off the ship and escape the detectives searching for the fugitive Lulu.\nDuring the chaos onboard the ship they manage to sneak off in a row boat. It is Christmas time and a tall, handsome man in a long trench coat travels the foggy night. He comes upon a large group of towns people outside by the decorated Christmas tree drinking hot cider in celebration of the season. He meets a young woman and they share glances. Lulu, Schigolch, and Alwa are held up in a drafty room with only a bottle of whisky, some dried bread, and a candle. Lulu sits and does her make-up. Later she is being talked up by a man on the street and when he leaves, Schigolch tells Lulu that it is a shame; because he may have provided them some money. He is slyly conferring to Lulu that it is time for her to take on some customers for their survival on the streets. This is not a good time to be walking the streets as there have been several girls and women that have been killed by an unknown assailant who is known in history as Jack the Ripper. The tall handsome man that shared in cider with the young woman in the Christmas gathering meets Lulu and she immediately takes a liking to him. As she leads him to the room upstairs he holds a knife behind his back. He is the killer and she is unaware. He clenches the knife tightly overcome with an insatiable need to stab her dead, but her kindness overcomes his desire to kill. His maniacal episode passes. He drops the blade and continues up the stairs to be with Lulu. In the room they share an intimacy without words. It is a real affection, but as they embrace, a knife is on the table glimmering in the light. This sets off the chain of circumstances that ignite the killer within the seemingly gentle man. He reaches for it and as he kisses Lulu he stabs her to death.The ripper leaves the room and passes Alwa outside in the doorway. He continues to walk off into the foggy night, while Alwa presses his head to the wall upset that Lulu must resort to selling herself for their survival, and for the situation he finds himself in as a result of his love for Lulu. Schigolch sits in a local tavern as he watches the marching band go by in the street; he finally gets to eat a Christmas pudding. As Lulu lay dead alone in the drafty room; Alwas lost in his obsession over Lulu as he despairingly walks off on the streets alone, cold in the dark. --By Joseph A. Perez"

        "sinopsis": "Tibby, the wife of Samuel Sweetland (Jameson Thomas) dies, and shortly afterwards his daughter marries and leaves home, leaving him on his own with his two servants. His wife had told him that he should remarry after her death, so he pursues some local spinsters who were at his daughter's wedding after he and his housekeeper Minta (Lillian Hall-Davis) make out a list of possibilities.First is Widow Louisa Windeatt, but Sweetland is shocked and mad when she rejects his advances and says she is too independent for him. Next, he attempts to court Thirza Tapper, a nervous wreck who almost collapses when Sweetland proposes to her. She, too, rejects him because she says she has no need for a man, and he is furious yet again. He wanders outside as other guests arrive for her party. His bolshie servant Ash is helping at the party, wearing an ill-fitting coat and trying to keep his trousers up while doing his work at the party.While the others are outside listening to some singers, Sweetland proposes to Mary Hearn, but she rejects him as too old, and then bursts into hysterical laughter when he angrily tells her that she is \"full blown and a bit over.\"Later Sweetland tells Minta that he is not going to finish the list of women because he is so dejected. He leaves the room and Ash returns and tells Minta what an embarrassment to men that Sweetland is by going around and practically begging any woman to be his wife. Sweetland overhears this and orders Ash to saddle his horse because he is going to try number four on the list, Mercy Bassett, a barmaid at a local inn. After he leaves, it is revealed that Minta is in love with him. Bassett rejects him too and he comes home dejectedly. Meanwhile postmistress Hearn and Tapper compare notes and Hearn decides she should marry him after all and she goes to his house with Tapper.Having run through the women who have turned him down, Samuel sees Minta for the first time as more than a housekeeper and decides that she is the woman for him, if she'll have him. He tells her he has got used to being rejected and will not be angry if she rejects him, too. She accepts him and he tells her to put on the dress Tibby gave her. As she goes to the room, Hearn and Tapper arrive. Hearn says she is now willing to be his wife. Samuel says all should drink a toast to his wife to be and Hearn is sure it is her, until Minta comes down the stairs in an attractive dress. Hearn lapses into hysterics as Sweetland reveals that Minta will be his bride."

        "sinopsis": "After having led numerous military battles against the English during the Hundred Years' War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen, Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English.On 30 May 1431 Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.When she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.As the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.As more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven."

        "sinopsis": "An impoverished young woman named Letty Mason (Lillian Gish) travels west by train from Virginia to live at her cousin Beverly's isolated ranch in Sweetwater, Texas. On the way, she is bothered by the constantly blowing wind. Fellow passenger and cattle buyer Wirt Roddy (Montagu Love) makes her acquaintance and tells her the wind usually drives women crazy.Upon arrival, she is picked up by Beverly's closest neighbors, Lige Hightower (Lars Hanson) and the older, balding Sourdough (William Orlamond), who live 15 miles from her cousin. Wirt assures her he will drop by occasionally to see how she is doing.After endless miles in sand and wind, they arrive at the ranch. Beverly (Edward Earle) is delighted to see her, but his jealous wife Cora (Dorothy Cumming) gives her a cold reception, despite Letty saying she and Beverly (who was raised by Letty's mother) are like brother and sister. Cora is further angered when her children seem to like Letty better.At a party, Sourdough tells Lige that he intends proposing to Letty. Lige explains he was planning to do the same. After Wirt drops by, a cyclone interrupts the festivities. Most of the guests seek shelter in the basement, where Wirt declares his love for Letty and offers to take her away from the dismal place. After the cyclone passes, Lige and Sourdough talk to Letty in private. When they flip a coin to see who will ask for her hand in marriage (Lige wins), Letty thinks it is just a joke.Afterward, Cora demands that she leave Beverly alone and that she has to leave the ranch. Because she has neither money nor a place to go, she decides to go away with Wirt, but then Wirt reveals that he wants her for a mistress, informing her that he already has a wife. She goes back to Cora, who tells her to choose from her two other suitors. She marries Lige.When Lige takes her home, he kisses Letty for the first time, but her lack of enthusiasm is unmistakable. Worse for the drink, he becomes more forceful, and this makes her tell him that he has made her hate him, which she did not want to do. Lige promises her he will never touch her. He states he will try to make enough money to send her back to Virginia. In the meantime, Letty works around the house, but is bothered by the ever present wind.One day, Lige is invited to a meeting of the cattlemen, who must do something to avoid starvation. Letty, terrified of being left alone with only the wind for company, begs to go with him. He agrees. After she cannot control her horse in the fierce wind, he has her get on behind him on his horse. When she falls off, Lige tells Sourdough to take her home.When the cattlemen return, they bring an unwanted guest, an injured Wirt. After he recovers, Lige insists he participate in a roundup of wild horses to raise money for the cattlemen. Wirt goes along, but later sneaks away and returns to Letty. Out of her mind with fear as she endures the house shaking from the worst wind storm yet, Letty faints soon after Wirt's arrival. He picks her up and carries her to the bed.[note 1]The next morning, Wirt tries to persuade Letty to go away with him, but she rejects him. He insists, noting Lige will kill them both if they remain. As Wirt becomes more aggressive, Letty picks up a revolver to defend herself. Confident that Letty will not fire, Wirt grabs the gun and it goes off, killing him. Letty decides to bury him outside. After she is done, the wind uncovers the body, terrifying her.When Lige returns, Letty is so glad to see him, she kisses her husband. She then confesses she killed and buried Wirt. When Lige looks outside, however, the corpse is nowhere to be seen. He tells Letty that the wind can remove traces when a killing is justified. He has enough money to send her away, but Letty declares she loves him and that she no longer wants to leave. She is no longer afraid of the wind."

        "sinopsis": "Else, played by Betty Amann, becomes the tragic hero of Asphalt as her character transcends her unhappy criminal life to redeem herself in an unfolding confession of true love. As fitting with the harsh urban landscape of Berlin, Else begins as a gorgeous trickster when the story begins. Her high fashion clothes and perfectly ornamented makeup make her deserving to be peering over diamond cases while batting her eyes in want at the jeweler. We immediately experience the power of her female persuasion between the cuts between the almost possessed jeweler and her. She is good at what she does- seducing men- not stealing diamonds parse. She lies as she gets caught professing it was the first time, that she needed the money. Even when she meets Albert, played by Gustav Frohlich, she insists her luxurious apartment and belongings are not hers. She maintains her story and pristine female fatal composure until she flings herself into his arms and confesses to him, I like you. A close-up captures the couples passionate embrace. Yet, it is the rare moments when Else thinks about Albert that we begin to see her character evolve. With most of her expression transcending from her sad eyes throughout the film. Her first smile in the film comes after she finds the passport photo of Albert in her apartment. Gazing at the photo she smiles comparing him to her criminal older and uglier boyfriend in a photo beside her. This is the first soft moment with this character and the smile is very contrast as well. She will stare and smile at his picture again in the nightclub, when she becomes compelled to return his passport and give him a gift of cigars, a scene that results to a confession of love from both Else and Albert. It is when Albert is at Elses feet, begging for her to be his wife when she can no longer stand the differences between them. As he looks up to her in her white elegant dress and she runs away. She breaks away and exposes all her stolen goods from her criminal past. Her confession becomes a conduit metaphor for the criminal underworld of the city as she pleads with him, Dont go, dont let me go down. She is looking for mercy and seeking to be redeemed. She believes he can save her and this is motivation enough for her to confess. In the closing scene, the director portrays Else in a dark suit voluntarily turning herself into the police. Her once flashy, teary eyes are humbled and filled with tears of compassion and love. This confession becomes an expression of her love and she rescues her lover from being accused of murder. She is able to smile once again as Albert follows her and professes he will wait for her. The gorgeous closing shot shows Albert watching Else through a barred doorway as she goes off to jail or some dark underworld in the city."

        "sinopsis": "A tire is spinning. A police van speeds along city streets. Inside, a Morse Code radio message containing an address is received. The van stops at a seedy building, and two plain clothes police go up some stairs. Quietly, they crack open the door of a room where a man lies atop a bed, reading a paper. A gun is on his bedside table. The man realizes he is about to be arrested and makes a move towards his gun, but the detectives move faster, and arrest him.The man is in a lineup in a patio with dozens of others. A young woman slowly passes by the men, and identifies the man, suggesting a rape charge will follow. The detectives work is finished, they ride home on a train. A fat man {Hitchcock} one seat away is being annoyed by a little boy who pulls down his hat,Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber (John Longden) goes out for the evening with his capricious girlfriend Alice White (Anny Ondra), first going to a crowded tea house. As they jockey for a table, she misplaces one glove and Frank must go back to retrieve it.They bicker in a series of minor quarrels. Frank seems more interested in police work than in her. They talk about going to a movie, a new crime film. Frank scoffs, claiming its too unrealistic, but Alice comments: I heard they got a real criminal to direct it.Alice capriciously changes her mind back and forth driving Frank off. She has a note from another man arranging to meet in that teahouse, and she spots him and they make signs. Frank decides he has had enough, pays and leaves, but stays near the door.Alice leaves with Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard), an artist. Frank sees them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while.Alice is invited by Crewe to visit his studio, she demurs coyly but finally agrees. We learn that Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop, a short distance away.A suspicious looking man is lurking around, observing them.Crewe finds a note at the entrance. He goes behind the stairs ask the concierge Mrs. Humphries (Hannah Jones) at what time the note was left. Alice is already several steps up the stairs, so Mrs. Humphries does not see her.The camera follows Crewe and Alice as they climb multiple flights to the top floor. The artist's intentions are obvious, but Alice is unaware and innocently flirts with the artist by saying she might like to be his model, cooing with delight over his attentions.At his studio, a finished painting of a jester laughing at the viewer draws Alice's attention.Alice asks how the pallette is held, then paints a head on an empty canvas, which she playfully signs. Crewe then sketches a nude female body to go with the head. Crewe says he will paint her if she puts on a dancer's costume that is hanging on a screen.Crewe sings and plays \"Miss Up-to-Date\" on the piano while we watch Alice undress behind the screen.They have some fun and the guy tries to push too fast forward as he forces a kiss on Alice. She says she wants to go home. After she takes off the costume, he takes hold of her street clothes and flings them out of reach, and assaults her, dragging her to his bed.In silhouette we see the couple struggling wildly behind a curtain that hides the bed. A bobby patrolling outside below the apartment window while Alice screams hears nothing.To defend herself, Alice grabs a nearby knife and stabs him to death. She walks back from the bed in a daze, the knife gleaming in her hand.The jester painting appears to be looking at her, and she uses the knife to stab at the canvas.The camera swoops about to convey Alice's disorientation.Alice removes evidence of her presence in the flat. She obliterates her signature on the canvas and looks around carefully as she picks up her belongings.However, she forgets one glove behind. She sneaks noiselessly down stairs, opens the door and leaves. The mysterious man is still lurking around, watching.Alice walks aimlessly along empty streets which seem filled with reminders of the murder. In her eyes, a neon advertisement showing a cocktail shaker becomes a hand plunging a dagger. Whenever she sees an extended right hand, she thinks of Crewe's hand extending from the deathbed.Alice wanders back into her home at dawn and sneaks inside. She lies down clothed, pulls up the covers of her bed, and pretends to be asleep when her mother (Lisa Evans) brings her a cup of tea. After her mother leaves the room, Alice takes off her clothing and changes into a fresh outfit for the day.The concierge discovers the body very early that morning, calls police, and soon after, the murder is the talk of the neighborhood.During the family breakfast that morning, Alice listens to a customer neighbor carrying on about the killing. \"Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick -- that's a British way. But a knife! How could anyone use a knife?\"Alice is asked to slice the bread, and her hand trembles as she grasps the knife. The neighbor babbles on. We hear only the word \"knife\" stabbing at Alice's conscience, the rest of visitor's nonstop comments become softer and softer, but the word KNIFE stays loud. A last one is practically a scream, and the bread knife leaps out of Alice's hand.Alice's father (Charles Paton) yells \"Ere! You might've cut someone with that!\"Meantime, Frank has been assigned to the case and finds one of the gloves at the murder scene. He recognizes the glove as Alice's, so Frank uses his position to subvert the investigation by hiding it in his pocket. Assuming that Alice is the killer, he goes to visit Alice at her father's shop.Frank takes Alice aside to talk in a phone booth, making it clear it that he loves Alice and will protect her. He is clearly devastated as he confirms she indeed is the killer.At this point, petty thief Tracy (Donald Calthrop), the lurking suspicious figure who saw Alice entering and leaving the artist's flat, interrupts the two and attempts to blackmail the couple, showing he has the other glove with him. First he just asks Frank to pay for an expensive cigar.To gain time, Frank and Alice tell the family he is a very special business friend of Frank's. The blackmailer, befuddling Alice's parents, demands breakfast, and relishes it, while Frank watches in disgust.Frank predicts Tracy's blackmail will fail. His conflicted willingness to cover up for Alice receives an unexpected boost when Tracy is fingered as a suspect in Crewe's death. The concierge identifies him as being at the scene of the crime. Tracy has a police record so suspicion falls on him.Frank receives the new information and sneers when he goes back to face Tracy with it, and announces he has called the police to make an arrest. Cornered, slimy, but dirt-poor, Tracy offers to give back the money, and says he wasn't serious about the blackmail. \"One's got to live, you know!\" The same police van of the early scenes rushes along the streets.To avoid arrest, Tracy jumps out, shattering a back window. The camera, as if startled by the commotion, dollies backward and we see the posse of lawmen rushing after Tracy.After being taken into custody, while being transported in a van, Tracy simply jumps out of the van at a traffic stop, and the pursuit continues on foot. He attempts to shake off the pursuers by losing them inside the vast British museum.While the museum chase is going on, Alice sits in her bedroom, meditating and reflecting on her situation.The camera cuts back and forth between Alice's meditation and the chase. Tracy is first chased in large rooms with display cases, corridors, then Tracy flees down a hanging rope while an enormous Egyptian stone face stares impassively.After being surrounded, he clambers to the top of the main dome and dies after falling through the skylight.Alice's reflections end and she resolves to go to Scotland Yard and confess.She asks to talk to the chief inspector (Harvey Braban) about the murder. When she is ushered in, Frank is already there. She is interrupted before she has her say, first by Frank, who says her statement would be meaningless since the case is solved, and then by an unrelated phone call to the chief inspector. Frank escorts her out.She tells Frank that she killed Crewe, because she was about to be raped and was defending herself.Frank clenches his fists and stares towards the camera as if to claim his deception has been vindicated.As a piece of evidence, the painting of the torn jester, is brought into the station, the sight of it troubles Alice's conscience.All seems well between Alice and the relieved Frank, as he and Alice walk away together, hand in hand, yet one senses Alice's unease behind her eyes in the final images."

        "sinopsis": "At a recording studio in New York City, Eddie Kearns (Charles King) sings \"The Broadway Melody\", and tells some chorus girls that he brought the Mahoney Sisters vaudeville act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by famed Broadway producer Francis Zanfield (Eddie Kane).Harriet \"Hank\" Mahoney (Bessie Love) and her sister Queenie Mahoney (Anita Page) are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their hotel apartment on 46th Street. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. The sisters Uncle Jed (Jed Prouty) arrives for a quick visit and offers them a 30-weeks traveling show. Hank declines the offer, but consents to think it over.Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a little girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. At the theater, A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it, but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister.During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for \"The Broadway Melody\" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious wealthy playboy Jacques \"Jock\" Warriner (Kenneth Thomson). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.Over the following two weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and the deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.Hank, after witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes that they are in love. She verbally berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.There's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists that they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says that it's the least that she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that she wasn't able to help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond woman who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank, Uncle Jed and the blond woman in a taxicab on their way to the train station. Hank promises her new dancing partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months."

In Pete's case, Kate is also interested in him, or at least she enjoys having him as a suitor.Pete proposes, asking Philip to make the case to Kate's tough father, Old Caesar (Randle Ayrton). The father refuses to consent to the marriage, because Pete is penniless. Pete decides to go to Africa to make his fortune, so he will be considered eligible to marry her, and he asks Kate if she will \"wait for him\". At first she jokes around, but finally she says yes. Pete then asks Philip to take care of Kate until he returns.In his absence, Philip starts calling on Kate almost every day. Kate and Philip become strongly attracted to one another, and start an affair while visiting an old mill.News reaches the village that Pete has been killed upcountry in Africa. Philip and Kate are shocked but Kate is relieved to realize that they can now plan their lives together. Philip's career has been going well, and he is preparing to assume the powerful position of Deemster, the island's chief magistrate.However, it then turns out that Pete is still alive, and has been successful in Africa. He lets Philip know via telegram that he is returning. Pete arrives and is extremely happy to be back to his village and to see his old sweetheart. Philip and Kate are shocked and appalled, but they do not let anyone know what has passed between them. Old Caesar is now delighted to agree to Kate marrying Pete. The wedding reception is celebrated in the old mill, where Old Caesar sternly warns the newlyweds to remember that God will punish anyone who violates the vows of marriage.Kate is still in love with Philip, and can hardly bear to be married to Pete.As the weeks pass, Pete is thrilled to find out that Kate is pregnant, and he naturally assumes he is the father. When Kate's daughter is born, not long afterwards Kate is desperate and decides to leave Pete. She walks out, leaving her baby behind, and a note saying that she had loved another man, and still loves him. Pete is appalled and does not know where Kate went, but he tells the villagers that Kate needed a vacation, so he sent her to London for a while. During the weeks she is gone, Pete proves himself to be a wonderful father, taking care of the baby very well, and comforting himself by believing that although Kate has gone, he still has their baby to love.Kate persuades Philip to hide her at his law offices, hoping she can still somehow have a life with him. However, Philip is about to become the Deemster, and he is unwilling to ruin his career by running off with her. Frustrated and distraught, Kate returns to the house to take the baby. She tells Pete he is not the baby's father. Pete is stunned and refuses to believe her. He also refuses to give up the child. In desperation, Kate leaves the house and tries to commit suicide by throwing herself off the quay.Kate is rescued by a policeman. Attempted suicide is classified as a crime, and Kate is brought to trial on the first day that Philip serves as Deemster. Now Philip is stunned and hardly knows what to do. When Pete appears in the courtroom to plead for his wife, Philip agrees to hand Kate over to him. But Kate refuses to go. Kate's father, Old Caesar, who is watching carefully, finally understands that Kate and Philip had an affair. Old Caesar gets up and loudly condemns Philip for being the \"other man\". Philip publicly admits his extreme moral failings. He removes his wig and surrenders his official position, and then leaves the court.In the final scene, Philip and Kate sadly prepare to leave the island. They arrive at Pete's house to take away the baby. Kate picks up the child, while Philip and Pete stand at opposite ends of the room. She brings the child over to Pete to say one last goodbye, and he breaks down, having finally lost everything. Philip and Kate leave the cottage to the jeers and condemnation of the villagers, who have been watching the scene through the windows."

A skeleton rises from behind a gravestone, frightening the fur off the cats. But an owl's hooting scares it, and it retaliates by throwing its skull and knocking the bird's feathers off.It's time for the skeletons to dance; and they perform as no living creatures could. They break apart into individual bones and then come back together again. They stretch and shrink into impossible shapes. They use each other as pogo sticks. One breaks off the two thigh bones of another and plays \"March of the Dwarves\" on its ribs like a xylophone. Another uses one of its bones as a bow and plays a cat's tail as if it were a stringed instrument. When the rooster crows, the skeletons fly into a panic, rushing at one another and smashing together to form a giant horse-like creature with many legs and four skulls stacked one upon the other.The creature dives into an open grave, knocking the stone lid over itself. But a pair of shinbones with feet are left behind, and they kick the stone to get in. A bony hand reaches out and grabs them. The skeleton dance is done."

        "sinopsis": "Professor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the Army and \"saving the Fatherland\". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Bäumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company. Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, \"You're going to be soldiers-and that's all.\"The new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating.The young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, \"Kat\" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat, and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers \"pay\" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.The recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they finally move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\nAll Quiet on the Western Front film ad with book cover art in The Film Daily, 1929\nThey hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the causes of the war and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the Kaiser; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, the leaders of Europe should be stripped to their underwear and made to \"fight it out with clubs\".One day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives at the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation. He is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. He desperately tries to help him throughout the night, bringing him water but fails to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.Going back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a Catholic hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterward. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive. Still, he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the war's actual situation; everyone is convinced that a final \"push for Paris\" is soon to occur. When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students. Professor Kantorek asks Paul to detail his experience, at which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners.This revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a \"coward\". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd Company filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden. He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the people's inability to comprehend the futility of the war. Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital, only to find that a second explosion has killed Kat. Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.In the final scene, Paul is back on the front line. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Smiling, he reaches out for the butterfly. While reaching, however, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. The final sequence shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery."

        "sinopsis": "The Bat has struck again, making off with a priceless necklace even after warning the police that he would rob the safe at precisely 1 a.m., after which he intends to go to country in order to give the police a rest. On his way through the village of Oakdale, the Bat notices someone robbing the Oakdale bank. Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion.Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia's decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn't like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She's even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia's niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don't water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home.A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving.Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window.It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he's supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet.A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He's been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat's face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago.The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it's Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn't ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying!As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

        "sinopsis": "It should first be mentioned that there was an English-language version of the film shot simultaneously with the German-language version. Both versions are nearly identical, but there are a few exceptions in the story. Due to the classic nature of the film, this synopsis is based on the original German version of the film.The film opens with the sound of geese and chickens clucking in a street marketplace. A woman washes a window outside a shop featuring a poster of Lola (Marlene Dietrich) which causes the woman to pose in a similar fashion. A shot of a door which reads \"Prof. Rath\" introduces the other main character, Professor Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) who is preparing for class. A bell is heard ringing in the background as teenage schoolboys run to class. The caretaker of the house is cleaning up the house as she reminds the Professor of breakfast. The Professor enters and has some tea/ coffee and begins to whistle to his bird. When he doesn't hear a reply he checks on the bird only to find it has died. This seems to sadden the professor, which is contrasted by the housekeeper taking the bird and dumping it in an open boiler. All she can say is: \"Anyway, he stopped singing long ago.\" The Professor goes on with his breakfast.We are then introduced to his class which is mostly composed of boys gathering in a group to look at a postcard, while one boy wipes a blackboard. The boy holding the card is blowing on it to make it react in a particular fashion that will be shown later. One boy sneaks up to the desk and takes the Professor's notebook and alters it to say Prof. Garbage (an easy pun in German, involving the mere addition of an \"Un-\" to the Professor's surname) and attempts to draw a crude illustration of the Professor until the pencil breaks.The Professor is then shown leaving his house for class, which is followed by the chiming of a large cuckoo-type clock. The clock is shown along with birds ironically perched on it and its statue figure which passes by from one side of the clock to the other as it chimes. The shenanigans are quickly broken up by a student barking \"Watch out! The old man!\" The students quickly return to their seats and are just as quickly instructed to sit down. The Professor takes his seat and blows his nose with his handkerchief, which leads to his noticing that his notebook has been defaced. He searches the class for the culprit and homes in on the most nervous of the bunch, Angst (the aptly-named character played by Rolf Muller). He instructs Angst to erase the additions, while Angst attempts to plead his innocence. The professor doesn't care and makes him erase it regardless.The Professor resumes his lesson for the day leading off with a passage from Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1 (the famous \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy). The Professor chooses a student to recite some of Hamlet, only to interrupt him because of his poor pronunciation of English. The Professor attempts to get the student to say \"the\" instead of \"za\" by placing a pencil in his mouth. He finally gets frustrated and has students write a paper on how the story of Julius Caesar would have differed if Mark Antony had not delivered his eulogy (yet another reference to a tragic and ill-fated Shakespearian character!). One student appears to be cheating, but is actually looking what is revealed to be a Lola postcard with a dress that can be blown to reveal her undergarments. The Professor realizes this and takes the card saying warning his students that there will be consequences as he places it in his own notebook. The troublemakers are not happy about this, while Angst, the teacher's pet, is pleased by the Professor's discovery implicating the other boys. The troublemakers decide to take action against Angst.After class is out the troublemakers hide outside the door and wait for Angst to leave class. When he does they trip him, causing his books to fly open on the ground. Angst's books have cards with Lola on them, which upsets the Professor. Angst and the Professor go to his office to talk about the cards. Angst swears the cards do not belong to him, but the Professor doesn't care for Angst's protestations, regardless of whether he is innocent or not. Angst then tells the Professor that the others don't like him because he doesn't go out at night to The Blue Angel with them to see girls. The Professors interest is piqued by these new facts.The Blue Angel is a cabaret featuring women singing more than dancing on a stage. Lola is finally seen on stage for the first time performing. She sings as the Professor is shown entering the bar. Meanwhile the students are backstage with Lola trying to sweet-talk her. Lola flirts, but does little more with the students. She then takes the stage again singing of her longing for a real man, a he-man, which leads to her declaring she will find the one tonight.This is followed by the Professor's entrance. The students see him enter and run to hide backstage. The Professor looks in the crowd for the students, but is interrupted by Lola's spotlight being pointed at his back. He turns to see Lola in person for the first time as she seems to be singing to him.This is interrupted when he sees one of his students and begins to chase him. As he looks through the rooms backstage he stumbles upon a very sad clown - an oddly foreboding image. There is a brief scene of a heavier woman doing a dance with only her eyes as a Middle-Eastern type of music is played.Meanwhile Lola comes backstage and asks what the man is doing in her room. After some pleasantries are exchanged she begins to undress to change into her next costume. The Professor seems very thrown off by this, leading him to block the doorway through which people are moving on and off stage. He is then referred to as a \"roadblock\" which causes him to move back out of the way. Lola goes upstairs and drops her panties to the Professor, then comes down fully dressed for her next performance.At this point the loud Magician is introduced, yelling to the other women performers. He is protective of Lola until he learns of the prestige of Dr. Immanuel Rath. Suddenly the Magician Kiepert (Karl Gerron) attempts to relate and justify his job to the Professor. Kiepert then demands that Lola go on stage as he puts on a fake mustache. The Professor accuses the Magician of inappropriately accommodating his students, whereupon the Professor immediately spots one of his students and chases them out.The next scene is probably the most out of place or random in the movie. Angst is sleeping in his bed when a noise wakes him. Shadows approach as some boys jump out and attack him by slapping him. This is obviously retaliation for telling the Professor about The Blue Angel. The Professor is then shown going home to sleep, but can't seem to shake the memory of Lola out of his head especially because her undergarments have ended up in his jacket mysteriously.The next day the Professor puts on his coat and goes to return Lola's panties. The Professor arrives, and the students are forced to hide in the cellar. The garments are exchanged, and Lola sees that the Professor is there to see her again. She shows a playful grin as she begins to seduce him, and the students watch from the cellar.Lola begins her game of cat and mouse. Babying the Professor by combing his hair, then asking him how beautiful he thinks she is. Before things get serious she blows some powder in his face and then treats him like a baby again. Things finally begin to progress with the Magician demanding that Lola drink with a visiting sailor with lots of cash. The sailor treats Lola rudely as the Professor watches. He becomes furious and chases out the sailor after a fight of sorts.The sailor then returns with the cops, causing the magician to hide the Professor in the cellar. The Professor finds his students and emerges from the cellar, bringing them up with him. The ordeal with the sailor is resolved by the police taking him back to the station because one of the parties to the scuffle is a sober Professor, who is much more credible to the Officer than a drunk sailor. The Professor talks of punishing the students, but only chases them out.The Professor is then given drinks to calm his nerves, leading to his becoming pleasantly inebriated as he is serenaded by Lola. Lola sings of how she is falling in love again, and can't help it. The song is once again prophetic (like the sad clown and the Shakespearian references) of things to come.He wakes up in Lola's bed the next morning. Lola has a singing bird which comes as a delight to the Professor. She prepares breakfast for the two of them, which leads to the final part of her plan to trap her new love interest. The Professor runs to school when he hears the school bells. Because he is so late for class, a student is able to draw intricate drawings of the Professor's antics the previous night including one that depicts him as Cupid in love with Lola. The Professor tries to punish the students, but can't keep them under control. The head of the school realises that Rath's authority has been undermined and decides that the his actions have damaged his reputation to the point where he should either resign or be dismissed.The Professor is left with no choice but to follow his heart and propose to Lola. He packs up his items from the classroom and goes to Lola. One shot of the Professor in the empty classroom shows his despair, as well as being another indication of things to come. The group of travelling artistes Lola is in are packing to leave for another town as the Professor arrives. He proposes to marry to keep her. This leads first to her laughing, but ultimately to the couple marrying.Wedding music is played as the two have a reception with all of the other members of the traveling show. The Magician then makes eggs appear from the Professor's nose to the delight of everyone. The eggs cause Lola to begin clucking like a chicken, in turn causing the Professor to crow like a rooster.Early in the relationship the Professor sees some postcards spilling from Lola's suitcase, which he objects to strongly. He states that as long as he has a penny to his name, they will not sell those postcards. Lola keeps them just in case, which turns out to be not too much later as the next time the Professor is shown he is selling the postcards at a show. This is the first scene in which the Professor is shown as being lower than the others in this group. He has fallen from his former position and is now just the person that fails to sell postcards at show. Even Lola begins to talk down to him at this time. The Professor seems to be at his breaking point and leaves during the humiliating talk aimed at him by the others in this group. However, he quickly returns to Lola.Lola has the Professor assist in getting her ready for the next show. He takes her curler and burns a page of a calendar. This signifies the passage of time, which changes from days to the year 1925 to the year 1929. The Professor is now playing with clown make-up and appears to be a shadow of his former self as he applies a clown nose and wig in front of a mirror. It now seems that he has become the sad clown from earlier in the film.As the Professor is preparing his costume, the Magician enters to tell him that the next town they will be visiting is the Professor's hometown and that they will be performing at the Blue Angel. The Magician seems to be in extra high spirits because the show is a sell-out because of the top attraction: the former professor turned clown!The group arrives at the new venue just as some performers are leaving. The Strongman, Mazeppa (Hans Albers) decides to stay a little longer when he sees Lola. Mazeppa is sure he is in love with Lola and pursues her. Lola seems to be faithful to her husband despite Mazeppa's clear interest in her.Before his big performance the Professor is prepped by the Magician. During this process the Professor just stares coldly into space, a shell of a person just sitting in a chair. The Magician constantly encourages the blank-faced Immanuel to perform well. Meanwhile Mazeppa and Lola walk past the Professor together poking fun at him, which does not stir any emotion in him. Before he can do anything or find the source of the laughter upstairs he must go on stage. Lola even comes downstairs to force the scared-looking Professor onstage.Finally the Professor makes his big stage debut with the Magician. The confused Clown or former Professor is then humiliated by the Magician who breaks eggs on the Clown's head as he watches Lola flirting with Mazeppa backstage. Finally the Professor appears to crack up mentally, crowing wildly like a rooster at the Magician's command. He continues to crow as he chases Lola trying to kill her. His attack is eventually stopped by a group of men led by Mazeppa. They wrap the Professor up in a strait-jacket.Once the Professor has finally calmed down the Magician tries to reason with him. The Magician promises to take care of the situation for the Professor after undoing the strait-jacket. Once the Professor is alone he takes a coat and hat and sneaks out. As he sneaks away he hears Lola singing the \"falling in love again\" song, which is obviously directed at a new man. The Professor slowly stumbles through the streets until he reaches his old school. He rings on the bell until someone opens the door. The Professor stumbles past this person and into his former classroom. He collapses grasping onto his desk, mirroring the scene in which he left the school for the first time. The Man at the door finds the Professor at the desk and attempts to remove him from it, but is unsuccessful. He leaves the Professor grasping the desk as a lone spot light shines on him and bells ring in the background.Ende."

Gilbert falls for Mademoiselle Olga (Leni Stengel) while Tommy meets up with the flighty Annette (Dorothy Lee, a Wheeler and Woolsey favorite) and proceeds to woo her, unaware that she is the youngest daughter of commanding officer Colonel Marshall! Keeping one step ahead of the army's grip proves to be a challenge for the two oddballs, who wind up on the front lines in the middle of a fierce battle! Amidst all of their hysterical double-talk and screwball antics, the pair find time to sing and dance with their gals, as Tommy serenades Annette with \"Whistling the Blues Away\" and Gilbert gets stripped down to his shorts in a duet with Olga called \"Nothing But Love.\""

Olga (Glenda Farrell) becomes his dance partner and girlfriend at the local taxi dance club.Joe tries to drift away from the gang and its activities including running several speakeasys and illegal gambling casinos, but Rico (whom the gang now refers to by his nickname 'Little Caesar') makes him participate in the robbery of the nightclub where he works. Despite orders from underworld overlord \"Big Boy\" (Sidney Blackmer) to all his men to avoid bloodshed, Rico guns down crusading police crime commissioner Alvin McClure during the robbery, with Joe as an aghast witness.Rico accuses Sam of becoming soft and seizes control of his organization. Rival boss \"Little Arnie\" Storch (Maurice Black) tries to have Rico killed, but Rico is only grazed by a bullet during a drive-by shooting. Rico and his gunmen pay Little Arnie a visit, after which Arnie hastily departs for Detroit. The Big Boy eventually gives Rico control of all of Chicago's Northside.Some months later, Rico becomes concerned that Joe knows too much about him. He warns Joe that he must forget about Olga, and join him in a life of crime. Rico threatens to kill both Joe and Olga unless he accedes, but Joe refuses to give in. Olga calls Police Sergeant Flaherty and tells him Joe is ready to talk, just before Rico and his henchman Otero (George E. Stone) come calling. Rico finds, to his surprise, that he is unable to take his friend's life. When Otero tries to do the job himself, Rico wrestles the gun away from him, though not before Joe is wounded. Hearing the shot, Flaherty and another cop give chase and kill Otero. With the information provided by Joe, Flaherty proceeds to crush Rico's organization.Desperate and alone, Rico retreats to the gutter from which he sprang. A few weeks later, while hiding in a flophouse, he becomes enraged when he learns that Flaherty has called him a coward in the newspaper. He foolishly telephones the cop to announce he is coming for him. The call is traced to the phone booth where Rico is. He runs from the police and hides behind a large billboard. Refusing to surrender, Flaherty personally shoots at the billboard with a tommy gun. Ironically, the billboard shows an advertisement featuring dancers Joe and Olga. The police walk around the billboard to find Rico dying on the ground who with his last breath mutters, \"Mother of mercy... is this the end of Rico?\""

        "sinopsis": "In Morocco in the late 1920s, the French Foreign Legion is returning from a campaign. Among them is Légionnaire Private Tom Brown (Gary Cooper). Meanwhile, on a ship bound for Morocco is the disillusioned nightclub singer Amy Jolly (Marlene Dietrich). Wealthy La Bessiere (Adolphe Menjou) attempts to make her acquaintance, offering to assist her on her first trip to Morocco. When she politely refuses any help, he gives her his calling card, which she later tears up and tosses away.They meet again at the nightclub where she is a new headliner. Also in the audience is Private Brown. Amy, who comes out on stage wearing a man's tuxedo, top hat and coat tails, is first greeted by boos, which she coolly ignores. Tom begins to clap, interrupting their jeers, and others follow suit. After the noise subsides, she sings her number (\"Quand l'amour Meurt\" translation: \"When Love Dies\") and is met with ecstatic applause. Seeing a woman in the audience with a flower in her hair, she asks if she may keep it, to which the woman responds \"of course\". She playfully kisses the woman on the mouth, and throws the flower to Tom. Her second performance (\"What am I bid for my Apple?\"), this time wearing a feminine dress, is also a hit. After the number, she sells apples to the audience, including La Bessière and Brown. When Amy gives the latter his \"change\", she slips him her key.Later that night, Tom sets out to take Amy up on her offer. On the street he encounters Adjudant Caesar's wife (Eve Southern). She clearly has a past clandestine relationship with him, which she desires intensely to maintain, but Tom rejects her. Entering Amy's house, they become acquainted. Her house is plastered with photos from her past, of which she, like a Foreign Legion soldier, reveals nothing. He asks Amy if the man in the photographs is her husband, and she answers that she has never found someone good enough, a sentiment shared by Tom. She has become embittered with life and men after repeated betrayals, and asks if he can restore her faith in men. He answers that he is the wrong man for that, and that no one should have faith in him. As they talk, she finds herself coming to like him. Unwilling to risk heartbreak once again, she asks him to leave before anything serious happens. As he leaves, he encounters Caesar's wife again. Her husband, Tom's commanding officer, watches undetected from the shadows. Meanwhile, Amy changes her mind and seeks Tom out. With Amy in arm, Tom leaves Madame Caesar, who then hires two street ruffians to attack the couple. Tom manages to seriously wound both, while Amy and he escape unscathed.The next day, Tom is brought before Adjutant Caesar (who had been watching them clandestinely) on the charge of injuring two allegedly harmless natives. Amy clears him, but Caesar makes him aware that he knows about Tom's involvement with his wife. La Bessiere, whose affections for Amy continue unabated, knows her concern for Tom and offers to use his weight with Caesar to lighten his punishment. Instead of a court martial, Tom is released from detention and ordered to leave for Amalfi Pass with a detachment commanded by Caesar. He suspects that Caesar intends to rid himself of his romantic rival, and fears for his life were he to go. Amy is saddened by the news that he is leaving. Meanwhile, Tom, war-weary and enamored with Amy, plans to desert to be with her.That night at the nightclub, La Bessiere enters Amy's dressing room. He gives her a lavish bracelet, which she attempts to refuse, before setting it on her table. At the same time, Tom, intending to tell her of his plans, arrives at the door of her dressing room. Tom overhears La Bessiere offer to marry Amy, an offer she politely turns down. La Bessiere asks her if it is because she is in love, to which she responds that she does not think she is. Asking her if she would make the same choice if not for \"a certain private in the Foreign Legion\", she answers that she does not know. After hearing this, Tom knocks on the door, and La Bessiere kindly leaves them alone so Tom can say goodbye to her. As they embrace, Amy tells him not to go, and he responds that he intended to do just that. He will desert and board a train to Europe, but if she would join him. She agrees to this. A buzzer signals time for her to perform, and she asks him to wait for her to return. After she departs, he notices the lavish bracelet on her dressing room table. Though he has fallen in love with her himself, Tom decides that she would be better off with a rich man than with a poor Legionnaire. He writes on her mirror, \"I changed my mind. Good luck!\"The next day Amy arrives with La Bessiere to see the company's departure, so she can bid Tom farewell. Adding further injury, he hides the depth of his feelings for her by having several women in his company, who cling to him so doggedly that Amy must maneuver herself between them to shake his hand. She asks La Bessiere about the women trailing after the company, who explains that they follow the men. She wonders how they keep pace with them, and he answers \"Sometimes they catch up with them, and sometimes they don't. And very often when they do, they find their men dead.\" Amy remarks that the women must be mad to do such a thing, to which La Bessiere responds \"I don't know. You see, they love their men.\"On the march to Amalfi Pass, Tom's company detachment runs into a machine-gun nest. Caesar orders Tom to deal with it, and Tom suspects it is a suicide mission. To his surprise, Caesar decides to accompany him. Drawing his pistol (apparently to kill Tom), Caesar appears to be killed by the enemy.Though in a relationship with La Bessiere, Amy pines for Tom. She is devastated by his treatment of her, and begins drinking heavily and acting erratically at work. La Bessiere enters her dressing room to find her singing gayly. He asks if she is in high spirits because she has heard news of Tom. She leads him to the mirror to show him the note Tom left, which she had hidden behind a flower pot. Still concealing her grief, she asks him to pour her a drink, before throwing its contents on the mirror and breaking the glass. La Bessière consoles her, and Amy eventually accepts his proposal.Later, at their engagement party, La Bessiere and Amy learn that what's left of Tom's detachment has returned. Frantic, Amy rushes outside, but learns that Tom was wounded and left behind to recuperate in a hospital. She informs La Bessiere that she must go to Tom that very night, and wanting only her happiness, he drives her there.She goes to the hospital ward looking for Tom and finds his friend from whom Tom is always borrowing francs. He tells Amy that Tom has been faking an injury to avoid combat. Instead of the hospital ward, he has been residing in a canteen. Amy goes to the canteen to find Tom. He is accompanied by a native woman, who attempts to console him, knowing he is brokenhearted over leaving his love. He has carved \"AMY JOLLY\" inside a heart, covered by a heap of cigarette butts from his chain smoking. When Amy arrives, Tom asks her if she is married, to which she answers in the negative. He then asks if she plans to marry La Bessiere, to which she replies with a yes. He encourages her to marry him, not revealing his feelings for her. As he prepares to join his new unit, she finds his knife on the table, which he has forgotten. When he returns to collect it, she remarks that he has also forgotten to say goodbye. He asks her to see the unit off as they leave at dawn. Alone and distraught, Amy sifts through the pile of playing cards and cigarettes, and finds the heart with her name in it. The next morning, she attends as his unit disembarks. Amy is torn in leaving him with the knowledge of his love for her, but when she sees a handful of native women stubbornly following the Legionnaires they love, she joins them."

The door of the house where the action had taken place is opened to him, and several people burst in with him. There is a woman Edna Druce, lying dead on the floor, and another woman Diana Baring who seems to be in a sort of trance. Some of the people are in a theatrical group playing locally. The landlady says that Diana Baring is a lodger, and Miss Druce had supper with her tonight. There is a bloody fire poker on the floor near Diana.The policeman asks for some brandy for the injured woman, and the Diana Baring says that there is some in a flask on the table. But the flask proves to be empty.The theatrical people were lodgers and the landlady sets about making tea; one of the women in the company, Doucie Markham, goes to the kitchen with her, and talks non-stop.The kettle has boiled and the tea is ready, but as the two women go in to the sitting room, the policeman is just taking Diana Baring away, to the police station.The next evening we see the queue of people paying to go in to the theatre; there is a notice saying that due to the indisposition of Diana Baring and Edna Druce, their roles will be played by understudies. But at the police station, Diana Baring is in a cell.At the theatre, Edna Baring's understudy is going on stage; the police inspector has arrived and wants to ask questions. Tom Drewitt is an actor about to go on; the inspector asks him if he saw Mrs Druce and Miss Baring leave the theatre together last night. Drewitt pauses to think very theatrically, and then says that the did; he remarked at the time to Fane, the leading man. But then Drewitt hears his cue to go on, and does so. Someone else comes off; it turns out to be Handel Fane, in a drag costume.Fane confirms that he saw the two women leave together; he went to his digs, but Ion Stewart went with him; he wanted to borrow some cigarettes. The action on stage continues and the inspector asks questions as best he can; Doucie Markham is waiting to go on and says that everyone knew about Edna and Ion Stewart carrying on .The action now moves to the law courts; Diana is on trial for murder. We see a brief selection of statements by a witness and counsel, but the facts of the case are so simple they do not seem to need elaboration. We now go to the jury room.A man takes it on himself to be the foreman and summarises the facts. There isn't much doubt that \"the girl\" (Diana Baring) did it, but the defence doctor suggested that she was in some kind of trance when the act took place, and was not responsible for her actions.The foreman asks everyone to write on a piece of paper their view of guilty or not guilty; it comes out as 7 to 3. One man abstained because he was uncomfortable with the responsibility of possibly condemning someone to death. But he then concedes that his opinion is guilty. Another man has failed to put in an opinion, and he seems not to understand the basic facts of the matter, but he too is persuaded to indicate guilty.One of the jurors who voted not guilty explains that she thinks Diana Baring was in a trance and not responsible for her actions at all, nor aware of them. Another woman points out that if they find her not guilty, that condition could re-appear and she could commit further violent crimes; the blood would be the hands of the jury. The woman reluctantly changes her verdict.Another man explains that he voted not guilty because Diana was a nice young woman; the sort that one would like for a daughter. The man now becomes embarrassed and changes his view too.Now only Sir John Menier, a famous actor, is left. He puts forward some inconclusive points in favour of not guilty, but everyone else gangs up on him and after some time he gives up and agrees to guilty.Sentence of death is passed on Diana.Now we see Sir John Menier in his flat; he is full of remorse about the verdict; he is convinced that Diana was innocent. He determines to get hold of the members of the touring theatrical company, and cancels his own acting engagements in the meantime. We see that Edward Markham and Doucebell Dear have advertised in The Stage periodical that they are \"disengaged\" (that is, out of work). Sir John sends them a telegram, asking Markham to come to his residence later that day. The chaotic hand-to-mouth existence of the Markhams is fully on display at this stage, but Markham goes. Sir John patronises him heavily, but eventually asks him about the \"inner history\" of the case. Markham's wife Doucie is brought in as well. Sir John shows excessive respect to the Markhams, and their social inferiority is heavily underlined.Doucie recalls that when they were woken on the evening of the murder, she saw a policeman in the street, and he then disappeared. Sir John goes with them to their house and the three of them spend some time looking out of the bedroom window in an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the night. Then there is a commotion at the house where the murder took place and they go there. The lady of the house lets them in and they see where the murdered woman lay.Could anyone have got in the house at the back? Well only someone who knew the house well, Miss Mitcham, the householder then reels off a list of friends of the murdered woman who had called. She also recounts how she heard women's voices at the moment the body was found: definitely not a man. Sir John goes int the other room and calls Miss Mitcham in a falsetto female voice; she is completely misled and for a minute is certain it was a woman calling. In Diana's bedroom there is a framed photograph of Sir John himself.They go to the theatre, and it emerges that the wash basin in one of the dressing rooms was broken when the company was there; and a cigarette case was left behind. Markham takes the cigarette case and they all look at the dressing room, which was used by Fane and Stewart. The basin is below a window that looks out on the houses \"round the corner\", where they have just been visiting.That night Sir John lodges in a local house; in the morning the lady of the house enters while he is still asleep, and several small children come with her and create mayhem, which Sir John tolerates with forbearance. But then Markham arrives and says that Doucei recognized the cigarettte case as belonging to Stewart, and that it has blood on it.The question of the policeman who Doucie saw is still worrying Sir John. He asks who dressed as a policeman in the play that was being performed; the answer is both Fane and Stewart.Sir John goes to the prison to talk to Diana; he wants to know the identity of a man who Diana had said was involved, but she has refused to name him. She continues to refuse now, but lets slip that he is a half-caste\". He shows her the cigarette case and she recognizes it, but says that it is not Stewart's.Now Sir John and Markham have tracked down Handel Fane; he has gone back to his old work as a trapeze artiste; we are at a circus watching him perform. Markham says that it is definitely him; he was always good at female impersonation.Back at Sir John's chambers, Handel Fane calls; he has been asked there by Sir John, lured by the promise of a good part in a play he has supposedly written. Sir John pretends that he is merely being auditioned for the part, but he then says that the play is about the inner history of the case of the murder of Edna Druce. He asks him to say a few lines, but first he sets the scene; in fact it is exactly as happened on the night, and Fane looks increasingly uneasy. Sir John encourages him to read the script that he has prepared. Fane does so, but when he turns a page the next page is blank; Sir John had intended Fane to fill in with what he did that night, but he stops, and excuses himself, and leaves.Now Sir John and Markham go to the circus where Fane is working, and burst in to his dressing room; he is only partly dressed. Sir John observes that he drinks brandy to steady his nerves. But Fane is on in a moment (although he doesn't seem to be in costume or made up yet) and Sir John and Markham leave, to return after Fane's performance.In the next scene, Fane goes into the circus ring, having quickly got into costume; he is dressed as a showgirl, with a massive ostrich feather headdress and a satin gown. His attendants take the gown from him and he is a leotard and tights, although his body figure is not at all feminine. He slowly climbs a rope ladder to a high trapeze. He performs some moves, but then visibly becoming distraught, he makes a noose out of a rope and puts it round his neck, and leaps off and dies.He has left a note for Sir John, detailing how he carried out the murder; he used the policeman's costume to make good his escape and climbed into the dressing room through the window ... that explains the broken sink. He had been in love with Diana, and this was the secret she kept; that he was a half-caste."

        "sinopsis": "This first of Jean Vigo's films takes up the then current \"city\" film genre and uses it as a critique of the idle rich and as a call to the working man to overturn this society. The 23-minute film begins with a section which visually introduces the subject, Nice, France. Then we see scenes of the idle rich along the Nice coast and enjoying spectator sports. Next follows visions of the common man, including street scenes, laundry being hung, and industrial images. The contrast of these two \"worlds\" is followed by an exuberant street carnivale, where social conventions are cast aside and common people give in to their passions. Finally, a near-caricature of the wealthy (a single crevassed face of a upper class woman) is transposed with a carnival mask, overturned. Large smoke stacks imply a higher vision, with Nice as it is goes up in smoke."

After work Dorothy fends off her boss, who wants to take her for a ride, by claiming to be married to a prizefighter. The girls then go to Coney Island. On the return steamboat trip, the women make a bet about attracting a certain man's attention, and Dorothy proceeds to annoy him by playing a ukulele. This man is Eddie Collins; after his initial grouchy reaction to the women, he slowly forms a connection with Dorothy and sees her home. Eddie works in a radio shop and dreams of having a shop on his own, for which he has been saving.Eddie forgets to show up for a date and Dorothy angrily finds him in his boarding house, where they remain together until 4 a.m. Eddie walks her home but she is afraid to go up, fearing the reaction of her abusive elder brother who is her guardian. Eddie proposes marriage as a solution and Dorothy joyfully accepts. Her brother calls her a tramp and evicts her from her home. Dorothy suffers some anxiety the next day when Eddie seems to have disappeared; he then turns up, having made arrangements for a new place to live, and the two are happily married.Ten weeks later, Dorothy confides to Edna that she is pregnant, but is reluctant to tell Eddie the news when she learns that he is ready to open his new shop, an expensive commitment. Instead she tells Eddie that she would like to return to work, to which he objects. Wrongly guessing that she really wants a larger place to live, Eddie cancels his plans for the shop in favor of a lavish new apartment and the purchase of new furnishings, increasing Dorothy's worries. By the time Eddie finally finds out he is to become a father, the two mutually misunderstand that the other is unhappy about the pregnancy, resulting in a strain on their marriage. The strain intensifies when Eddie stays out late at night to earn extra money as a boxer to pay for the services of Dr. Burgess, the best obstetrician in the city, all without telling Dorothy. Eddie is being pummeled in one of these prizefights while Dorothy leaves for the hospital; when he returns and Dorothy sees him bruised and bandaged, she assumes he was in a barroom brawl and turns her back on him. After their son is born, Dorothy plans to leave Eddie; however, before that can happen the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the couple returns home together to raise their child."

        "sinopsis": "Shelah Fane, an actor shooting a movie in Hawaii, asks for time off, and goes to meet the man she is dating. Her friend Julie comes to her dressing room and shows Shelah a newspaper article about a psychic named Tarnaverro coming to town. Shelah says she has sent for him to decide if she should marry the leading man, Alan Jaynes. Later, as Sheila and Jaynes are out driving, she promises to give him an answer that evening.At the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Charlie Chan goes undercover to meet Tarnaverro. Tarnaverro calls Chan out as a policeman. Chan wants to know if he has information about the murder of Denny Mayo in Hollywood three years ago.Shelah arrives at the hotel for a psychic reading. Over a crystal ball, Tarnaverro tells her that he sees something in her past, and describes the murder Chan mentioned. She admits to being in the house the night of the murder.Later, Shelah is in tears after deciding not to marry Jaynes. Anna, a maid, comes in to deliver some flowers, but on seeing a torn photograph, drops them. The flowers are from Robert Fyfe, and Shelah sets up a meeting with him.Jessop, a butler, finds Anna distraught. He tells her that he loves her and would do anything to help her.Later, Jaynes confronts Tarnaverro, asking him why he advised her not to marry him. Chan intervenes before a fight ensues. Jaynes stalks off, and Tarnaverro tells Chan he may be able to show him a murderer that day.The cast meets for a party, but Shelah hasn't shown up. Julie and her friend Jimmy go to find her, and discover her body. Julie insists on taking a ring from her finger before anyone can see.Chan meets Tarnaverro and asks him to ride with him to the murder scene. Tarnaverro says she was murdered because she knew who killed Denny Mayo. At the scene, Sheila has been stabbed through the heart, with flowers torn from her dress and crushed. Her wristwatch is smashed, possibly giving the time of the murder. Footprints are found at the scene.While interviewing the witnesses, a note is delivered to Tarnaverro. Chan takes it from him, but lights are turned out and part of the note is ripped away from him. Jessop says Shelah was crying over a man's photograph that morning. A woman says she saw a man running from the pavilion but she is not believed.Chan questions Julie about the jewelry she wore, but she does not admit to the existence of the ring, until Anna points out that Shelah was wearing it. All of the actors were also present at the murder of Denny Mayo. Chan's assistant finds the remains of the photograph, but one of the men manages to pocket a crucial part of it. Later, the man who ran from the pavilion appears - it is Robert Fyfe, Shelah's ex-husband. He tells Chan they had met at 8:00 and he had left at 8:04 to return to the theater.Chan's assistant brings in the man who had left footprints. He is a painter named Smith. He tells Chan he doesn't know what time he was on the beach, but he did hear voices on the pavilion, a man's and a woman's. He saw Shelah and Fyfe. Fyfe then cuts off the painter's explanation and confesses to the crime. However, Chan points out that she was alive at 8:12 when she had spoken with the cook. He then lets everyone leave.Chan then finds the torn-away part of the note under the carpet. It is from Shelah to Tarnaverro, telling him to ignore everything she had said that afternoon.Smith tells his girlfriend that he will sell a painting to someone, or else he will tell. Meeting Robert Fyfe, he asks for $500, but Fyfe can only afford $100 and $200 later. As Smith leaves the rendezvous, he is shot, but survives.Chan goes to the library to go over newspaper articles concerning the Mayo case, but every picture in them has been cut out. The librarian tells him a woman had been the last to look at them, and identifies Julie as the woman. Julie denies cutting out the pictures, but gives Chan an anonymous note she had received telling her to do it. On Jimmy's urging, she also tells him that she had taken the ring, which had Mayo's name inscribed inside of it.Chan identifies the typewriter as one in the hotel. He then checks an alibi for Tarnaverro, and finds that he had changed his name from Arthur Mayo many years ago. He and Denny were brothers, and the pictures had been removed to stop Chan from realizing it.Smith's girlfriend accuses Fyfe of shooting him. At Smith's bedside, Smith reveals that Shelah had confessed to Tarnaverro that she had murdered Denny Mayo. Then Fyfe, who had known of that murder, tells Chan that Mayo had had a wife already and Shelah had shot him in a jealous rage. Smith also cops to stealing a tiara from Shelah and gives Chan the bullet with which he had been shot. Chan arrests Fyfe.Chan's chief of police wants to arrest Tarnaverro right away, but Chan suggests that the the heel that had crushed the orchids might provide a vital clue. At Shelah's house, they find a knife and scratches under a chair that show that the pin from the orchids had stuck in the murderer's shoe and then the murderer had sat in the chair.Chan convenes the suspects to reconstruct the crime. Tarnaverro sits in the chair, but still Chan thinks there is a mistake. He questions Jessop, who admits that he and Anna had rested in the chairs after the party. The telltale pin is found in Anna's shoe.Anna confesses to being Mrs. Denny Mayo. Tarnaverro had placed Anna, his sister-in-law, as a maid to Shelah to try to find evidence of her killing Denny Mayo. She killed Shelah in a rage after Shelah had torn up Denny's picture.As Chan attempts to place her under arrest, Jessop pulls a gun to try to free her. He is quickly subdued, but the gun turns out to be the one used to shoot Smith in an attempt to keep him quiet."

        "sinopsis": "Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard gets a call about the murder of wealthy Hugo Morris Drake, who was strangled with a suitcase strap while on an around-the-world tour with a party of other Americans. Dr. Lofton, the tour conductor, discovers that the strap came from his bag. Duff interrogates Walter Honeywood, a theatrical manager occupying the room next to Drake's, who hopes to meet his estranged wife, actress Sybil Conway, at San Remo and persuade her to join him on the trip. Duff then realizes that he cannot hold the twelve remaining tourists because he has no evidence or motive, and after they leave for Paris, Duff learns that Honeywood paid a hotel servant not to reveal that he and Drake exchanged rooms the night Drake was killed.That night, as the party stops over in Nice, a gloved hand fires a shot from some bushes and puts the gun in the hand of the deceased, Honeywood. When Duff arrives the next day, he learns that Honeywood is dead, apparently a suicide. Duff calls Sybil, who meets him at San Remo and says that the murderer is Jim Everhard, a jewel thief to whom she had been unhappily married. Years earlier, when Honeywood and Sybil ran away together, taking two bags of diamonds, Everhard vowed to kill them both. Sybil agrees to point out the killer, but the figure with the gloved hand shoots and kills her.During the next part of the trip, Mark Kennaway, the traveling companion to Patrick Tait, an elderly criminal lawyer, becomes fond of Drake's granddaughter, Pamela Potter, who is continuing the trip to help track down the killer. In Hong Kong, Pam and Mark pass a street merchant who calls out Everhard's name as he passes. When Pam tells the tourist party that Everhard has been spotted, Mark realizes that she has placed herself in danger. As she sends a telegram to Duff, the gloved hand fires a gun at her, but Mark pulls her aside in time.Duff travels to Honolulu, the party's next destination, and after visiting his friend, Inspector Charlie Chan of the Honolulu police, he is shot in the back. Chan prepares to join the party on their voyage to San Francisco, and asks his chief to tell Duff \"Charlie Chan carries on.\" In his cabin on the ship, Chan hears movement by his window and, grabbing a gloved hand holding a gun, pulls the glove off. After clues implicate various male members of the party, the ship approaches San Francisco, and Chan writes identical letters to the suspects.At a party, Chan explains to the guests that Drake was murdered by mistake, for Everhard intended to kill Honeywood. Chan says that in order to save Everhard embarrassment, he has informed him in a note that he will not arrest him until they dock at San Francisco. The tourists then find the letters Chan left for them, while Chan fixes a dummy in front of the window of his own room. As he and Mark wait in the lifeboat, he turns on a switch rigged to light his room. The murderer enters the room and, after shooting at the dummy, is apprehended by Chan and Mark.As the others enter, the murderer is revealed to be John Ross, a limping lumberman who expresses regret over killing Drake, but not Honeywood or Sybil. He then asks Chan how he knew it was him, and Chan reveals that he did not know, but that he wrote the letters to draw the murderer out. Chan then dictates a cable to Duff and, seeing Mark and Pam together, says that they have decided \"two shall be one--more later.\""

        "sinopsis": "The officials of a city unveil a new statue, only to find The Tramp sleeping on it. They shoo him away and he wanders the streets, destitute and homeless, and is soon tormented by two newsboys. He happens upon a beautiful Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), not realizing at first that she is blind, and buys a flower. Just when she is about to give him his change, a man gets into a nearby luxury car and is driven away, making her think that the Tramp has departed. The Tramp tiptoes away.\nThat evening, the Tramp runs into a drunken Millionaire (Harry Myers) who is attempting suicide on the waterfront. (It is later mentioned that his wife has sent for her bags.) The Tramp eventually convinces The Millionaire he should live. He takes the Tramp back to his mansion and gives him a change of clothes. They go out for a night on the town, where the Tramp inadvertently causes much havoc. Early the next morning, they return to the mansion and encounter the Flower Girl en route to her vending spot. The Tramp asks The Millionaire for some money, which he uses to buy all the girl's flowers and then drives her home in the Millionaire's Rolls-Royce.After he leaves, the Flower Girl tells her Grandmother (Florence Lee) about her wealthy acquaintance. When the Tramp returns to the mansion, the Millionaire has sobered and does not remember him, so has the butler order him out. Later that day, the Millionaire meets the Tramp again while intoxicated, and invites him home for a lavish party. The next morning, having sobered again and planning to leave for a cruise, the Millionaire again has the Tramp tossed out.Returning to the Flower Girl's apartment, the Tramp spies her being attended by a doctor. Deciding to take a job to earn money for her, he becomes a street sweeper. Meanwhile, the Grandmother receives a notice that she and the girl will be evicted if they cannot pay their back rent by the next day, but hides it. The Tramp visits the girl on his lunch break, and sees a newspaper story about a Viennese doctor who has devised an operation that cures blindness. He then finds the eviction notice and reads it aloud at the girl's request. He reassures her that he will pay the rent. But he returns to work late and is fired.As he is walking away, a boxer persuades him to stage a fake fight, promising to split the $50 prize money. Just before the bout, however, the man receives a telegram warning him that the police are after him. He flees, leaving the Tramp a no-nonsense replacement opponent. Despite a valiant effort, the Tramp is knocked out.Some time later, he meets the drunken Millionaire who has just returned from Europe. The Millionaire takes him to the mansion and after he hears the girl's plight, gives the Tramp $1,000. Unbeknownst to the Millionaire and the Tramp, two burglars were hiding in the house when they entered. Upon hearing about the cash, they knock out the millionaire and take the rest of his money. The Tramp telephones for the police, but the robbers flee before they arrive, and the butler assumes he stole the money. The Millionaire cannot remember the Tramp or giving him the $1,000. The Tramp narrowly escapes and gives the money to the girl saying he will be going away for a while. Later, he is arrested in front of the newsboys who taunted him earlier, and jailed.Months later, the Tramp is released. Searching for the girl, he returns to her customary street corner but does not find her. With her sight restored, the girl has opened up a flourishing flower shop with her Grandmother. When a rich customer comes into the shop, the girl briefly wonders if he is her mysterious benefactor. But when he leaves with no acknowledgement, she realizes again she is wrong. While retrieving a flower from the gutter outside the shop, the Tramp is again tormented by the two newsboys. As he turns to leave, he finds himself staring at the girl through the window. His despair turns to elation and he forgets about the flower. Seeing that he has crushed the flower he retrieved, the girl kindly offers him a fresh one and a coin. The Tramp begins to leave, then reaches for the flower. When the girl takes hold of his hand to place the coin in it, she recognizes the touch of his hand and realizes he is no stranger. \"You?\" she says, and he nods, asking, \"You can see now?\" She replies, sobbing, \"Yes, I can see now.\" The Tramp smiles shyly at the girl as the film ends."

        "summary": "Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula bends a naive real estate agent to his will, then takes up residence at a London estate where he sleeps in his coffin by day and searches for potential victims by night.",
        "sinopsis": "The opening scene is on a quiet road surrounded by ominous mountains. A carriage with 6 people is going into the town near Count Dracula's castle. The driver drops everyone off and then talks to a townie about where Renfield (Dwight Frye), one of the passengers is going next. The townie pleads with him not to go, for that is the castle of Count Dracula and his Vampire wives.Despite the warnings, Renfield decides to go anyways. As he arrives, female Vampires are rising from their tombs in the castle as the evil Dracula watches. Then Renfield enters, though he is leery to. Of course after seeing some creepy creatures scurrying around the castle, he is greeted by the infamous Count, who bids him\"welcome\". Later, Renfield confirms that he kept his visit to Dracula's castle a secret, and then they discuss the sale of the castle which is what Renfield came for.They say good night and Renfield prepares to turn in. Three female vampires enter his room as he passes out from an encounter from the vampire bat (Dracula). In the next scene, Renfeild is shown as Dracula's ghoul that wakes him after sunset. Dracula is then shown on the very stormy ocean in a ship, on their way to London. After Dracula and his ghoul are on land, a newspaper describing the fate of the entire crew is displayed. It also stated the the only survivor was the now insane Renfeild who is under Dr's. supervision. Dracula waits until dark and then goes to the Opera and immediately introduces himself to Dr. Seward,His wife, their daughter Mina, and her escort John Harker. As they chat, Dracula tries to intrigue Mina, his next targeted victim. Later that night, the Vampire visits her while she is in bed. The next day, Renfeild is shown at the assylum screaming and raving. Then Vanhelsing is shown doing blood work on one of Dracula's dead victims. He tells Dr. Seward who is treating Renfield, and a few other men, that they are dealing with the undead. The two men meet with Renfeild to learn more about Dracula, and Renfeild asks to be sent far away. Then wolves start to howl in the distant air when there are no wolves in London. Renfeild goes mad after Vanhelsing reveals the truth about the howl. As he is carried away, Renfeild tells Vanhelsing that he knows too much to live any longer. Though no one believes Vanhelsing, they follow his commands that Renfeild be watched. Dracula stands out side of Renfield's cell and gives him some commands, telepathically.Then Dracula flies to Mina's bedroom and bites her on the neck. The next day, Harker, Dr. Seward, and Vanhelsing examine her bite marks. Then, The Count interrupts and confronts Vanhelsing, letting him know that he and other vampires know of this scientist's reputation.Dracula starts to talk to Mina and everyone suggests she go to bed and they stop the two of them from talking. Before Mina leaves, Dracula asks if he can check on her later. Then Vanhellsing opens a box and showed Dracula a mirror and Dracula swats the box away and looks at his new nemesis in shock to learn that Dracula's secret is now out. The Count apologizes and then leaves. He turns into a wolf and then is seen running across the yard, into the night. Then Renfeild comes in asking about Mina and warns them of Dracula's actions. Then as he talks about this evil force, Dracula comes to the window as a bat and Renfeild pleads to him for mercy. Suddenly, after Harker chases off the bat, a maid that sees Mina laying in the yard, screams. The 3 normal men run out to Mina's aid and the maid is left alone with Renfeild. His insane behavior causes her to faint. The next day Mina tells Vanhellsing about why she went out to the yard. Mina saw her friend Lucy, who was now a Vampire, wandering in the night looking for a victim. Knowing what she also is becoming, Mina tells Harker, her fiance. that she has changed and that they can not be together as a married couple. Harker accuses Vanhellsing of putting these thoughts in her head, and wants her to go away with him. Vanhellsing puts his foot down and prepares for Dracula to return for Mina tonight. They explain to Harker what Draclula is and convinces him to keep Mina there so they can all protect her. As he agrees, Renfeild appears again and warns them of his and Dracula's powers. Then Renfeild rants about his arrangement with Dracula, until the Count arrives.He confronts Vanhellsing and tells him that since he knows of Dracula's secret that he should leave England. Vanhellsing says he will stay and kill the Prince of Darkness. Then as Dracula tries to over power his enemy, Vanhellsing scares him off with a crucifix. Then Mina is shown in he r room with Harker . While the couple sits on the balcony, Vanhellsing prepares to hunt Dracula and find his liar. Meanwhile,the bat interrupts the 2 lovers and gets Mina to try to bite Harker. Vanhellsing stopped her with a crucifix. Then after she goes to sleep, Dracula comes to her room for her. Meanwhile Harker and Vanhellsing are searching the night for his liar. They suddenly see Renfeild who leads them right to where the Vampire sleeps. Then Dracula arrives with Mina and finds Renfeild. Thinking that he was betrayed, Dracula kills Renfeild and then takes Mina to his casket. By the time the two men find them, Dracula is asleep and Mina is wandering. Vanhellsing quickly pounds a piece of wood into the Counts heart, killing him and setting Mina free from the vampire's spell.\nThankyou, Blogmonstermike@ wordpress.com"

Randall's secretary, Miss Taylor, who is secretly in love with him, disapproves of the planned article, but Randall goes ahead with it, assigning an unscrupulous reporter named Isopod to pose as a clergyman to get into Nancy Voorhees' home. Her old identity hidden, Nancy is now happily married to Michael Townsend, who gave up his social position to marry her, and is planning her daughter Jenny's wedding to society bachelor Phillip Weeks. The Townsends mistakenly think that Isopod is an assistant of the minister who is marrying Jenny and confess their fears of having Nancy's past exposed. Randall prints Isopod's story and when Phillip's parents read the news they demand that the wedding be canceled. In total despair, Nancy commits suicide and when Michael finds her body, he too kills himself. Kitty Carmody, one of Randall's heartless reporters, finds the bodies, photographs them, and the Townsends once again make the headlines. Phillip stands up to his parents and insists on marrying Jenny, but in an uncontrollable rage, she goes to Randall and demands at gun point that he and the newspaper take responsibility for her parents' deaths. Fortunately, Phillip arrives and stops her from killing Randall. Randall accepts his guilt and quits the paper, followed by Miss Taylor."

Jan is engaged to clean-cut Dwight Winthrop, but their relationship is threatened when she meets Ace and becomes enamored of him and his exciting life.As Stephen continues to slip deeper into alcoholism, Jan breaks her engagement with Dwight and begins a clandestine affair with Ace, which grows into love. This comes to a head when Ace asks a drunken Stephen if he can marry Jan; Stephen, offended by the request, angrily refuses, and when he discovers Jan in Ace's boudoir, takes her home. They have an argument over their respective vices, and Jan proposes a deal: she will never see Ace again if Stephen will give up drinking. Despite knowing he cannot keep his promise, Stephen agrees, and the two of them leave for a cleansing camping holiday, along with Stephen's fiercely loyal assistant Eddie.After three months of sobriety, Stephen buys a bottle of liquor and boards a train for an unknown destination. Jan returns home to find her family has cut her off; feeling despondent, she visits Ace. He reacts angrily and possessively to her return and informs her that they will be married the next day. Jan slowly realizes what sort of man he really is, and sneaks away. Ace follows her to her apartment and, after a brief confrontation involving Eddie and Dwight, threatens Jan that she cannot get out of marrying him, and that if she marries Dwight he (Ace) will make sure Dwight is killed.Dwight goes to Ace's gambling club and kills him, then turns himself in for the murder. He tells the police that it was over a gambling debt, to protect Jan's reputation even though it will mean his own execution. Jan finds Stephen in a flophouse, seriously ill from his drinking binge, and brings him to Dwight's trial. Over the objections of both Dwight and the prosecuting attorney, Stephen puts Jan on the witness stand and brings out the full details of her relationship with Ace, and the true reason Dwight killed him. In an emotional appeal to the jury, Stephen takes the blame for everything that happened, explaining that his alcoholism meant that he had failed to be a proper father to Jan until it was too late. He then collapses to the floor, dead.Dwight is acquitted and, as Jan prepares to leave for a new life in New York, promises to follow her."

        "sinopsis": "Chicago's ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Pat O'Brien) wants to quit newspaper work and get married, but his editor, the ruthless and egomaniac Walter Burns (Adolphe Menjou), is determined to keep him on the job. Hildy refuses to talk to Walter, knowing his persuasive powers, so Walter sets off a fire alarm outside the apartment of Hildy's fiancee, Peggy Grant (Mary Brien). Unable to resist, Hildy runs to the street, after which Walter corners him and takes him out for drinks.While the two men drink, Walter reminisces about the great stories that Hildy covered and paints a boring picture of married life. Hildy manages to escape, and drops in on the press room at the courthouse, where the reporters are waiting for the hanging of Earl Williams (George E. Stone), who killed a black policeman. The reporters want Williams hanged at five in the morning, so they can make the morning edition with their stories. The politicians, on the other hand, want him hanged just before the election, so they can count on a large black vote.Hildy learns that a new psychiatrist has been called in to examine Williams. During the examination, Williams escapes. After the other reporters run from the room to investigate, Hildy bribes someone to tell him the story of Williams' escape using the money Peggy gave him for their trip to New York.Peggy follows Hildy to the press room, complaining that he always puts the paper ahead of her. In the midst of the manhunt, the governor's reprieve arrives, but no one sees the messenger except the sheriff and the mayor. They send the man away, asking him to come back after the hanging.While Hildy is alone again in the press room, Williams climbs in through a window. Hildy hides him in a roll top desk. Molly Malloy (Mae Clarke), a prostitute who helped Williams after he shot the policeman, sees Williams' hiding place, and when the other reporters are about to discover him, she jumps out the window to distract them, killing herself. In the confusion, Walter arrives. He is delighted with Hildy's work, flattering him with the notion that he has brought down a government. Furious at being kept waiting, Peggy breaks off her engagement. The reporters find Williams in the desk, and the sheriff arrests Hildy and Walter, but just then, the man with the reprieve returns, to Walter's delight. Williams walks away a free man.Peggy returns and Hildy quits his job and proposes to her again. Walter gets sentimental, and realizing that Hildy really doesn't want to leave the newspaper business, Peggy says she will stay in Chicago. Hildy insists on leaving and Walter gives him a pocket watch as a going-away present. As soon as Peggy and Hildy leave the room, however, Walter (evil and devious to the end) phones the police at the train's first stop, asking them to arrest Hildy, who he claims has stolen his watch."

        "summary": "When the police in a German city are unable to catch a child-murderer, other criminals join in the manhunt.",
        "sinopsis": "It's noon. Concerned parents are lined up outside the schools waiting to escort their kids home for lunch. Signs along the street ask \"Wer ist der Morder?\" (Who is the murderer?) of eight children killed over the past year. Little Elsie Beckmann [Inge Landgut] has just become victim number nine.Who is the murderer? It could be anyone (the viewer knows that it is Hans Beckert [Peter Lorre]). Neighbors are turning in neighbors and fingering strangers in the street just for talking to a child. The police are on the job 24 hours a day, but all they have turned up so far is some Ariston cigarette butts, some sugar grains, and a bag that held candy. They have investigated over 1,500 clues and have compiled 60 volumes of documents. Every thicket, every bush, every hole in the area has been combed. Every place from flop houses to underworld hangouts are being raided every night.In fact, the police investigation has been so thorough that the Underground is getting worried about the shakedowns. Underworld boss Schränker [Gustaf Gründgens] has come to the conclusion that the child killer must be found before the police ruin business. After a lengthy discussion with all the Underworld bosses in attendance [there is a wonderful scenario where the Underworld bosses discuss strategies while the police do the same, such that it hard to tell the difference between Gangsters and Police], they decide that the best solution is to monitor all children at all times and that the best persons to do that, the only ones who can be seen on the streets without arousing suspicions, are beggars. So, every street has its beggar sitting in a doorway, having a smoke on the corner, watching the children and noting anyone following or with a child.A break comes in the person of a blind balloon peddlar [Georg John] who hears a man whistling a tune and remembers the same tune being whistled by a man who purchased a balloon on the day Elsie Beckmann was murdered. He alerts his block's beggar, who follows the Beckert, who is leading a little girl into a candy store. When Beckert makes the mistake of throwing an orange peel on the sidewalk, the beggar pretends to slip on it and, while clutching Beckert for support, he transfers onto the back of Beckert's shoulder a big \"M\" that he previously chalked on his palm. The beggars are now able to follow the man with the \"M\" on his coat.Meanwhile, the police have been attempting to trace the origin of a postcard sent by the child killer to the local newspaper. While investigating released criminals and mental patients that fit the profile of the killer (lazy, indolent, and of strong and pathological sexuality), the police come to Hans Beckert's apartment. Beckert isn't home, but the landlady shows them in. Searching Beckert's room, they find some Ariston cigarettes and a red pencil, the likes of which was used to write the postcard. Certain that Beckert is the killer, the police lay in wait for Beckert to return.But Beckert is on the make. The little girl that he is with suddenly notices the \"M\" on his shoulder and offers to wipe it off. Certain that he has been caught, Beckert runs into an office building. The beggars contact Schränker who sends a group of gangsters to comb the building and capture the child killer. Unfortunately, the night watchman sounds an alarm, alerting the police. In the minutes before the police arrive, the gangsters find Beckert, and everyone, except for burglar Franz [Friedrich Gnass], manages to get out before the police arrive. To make Franz sing, Detective Lohmann lies to him that the night watchman at the building was killed during the gangsters' raid. The strategy has the desired effect. Fearing that he is going to face a murder rap, Franz tells how the gangsters have captured the child killer and taken him to an abandoned distillery to stand trial.Meanwhile, in the basement of the abandoned distillery a kangaroo court is in session, comprising of the leaders and the members of the various criminal organizations. When Beckert explains to Schränker that he is driven by a voice and an evil impulse he can't control, it is voted to eliminate him so that there is no chance of him ever getting free to murder another child. Only Beckert's appointed defense counsel [Rudolf Blumner] argues that, since Beckert is driven by an uncontrollable impulse, he cannot be held responsible for his actions and should be turned over to the police so that the state can render him harmless. At that moment, the police enter the distillery and escort Beckert away.Epilogue: As Beckert's real trial progresses, the mothers of the slain children listen to the verdict. The ultimate and final comment comes from Frau Beckmann [Ellen Widmann] who says that none of this will bring back the children and that mothers must keep a closer watch over them.

He sets up a robbery deal for them, promising to get them out of trouble if anything goes wrong, but when they bungle the job he abandons them. During Prohibition, they find a new ally, Paddy Ryan, who sets them up in the illegal brewery business. When Mike, Tom's older brother returns from World War I, he berates Tom for his dealings with gangsters and Tom angrily leaves home. The gang's big boss, Nails Nathan, uses Tom and Matt to pressure the local speakeasies, which are caught between rival gangs, into using only the beer that they sell. Tom grows into a ruthless gangster. One day he takes out his frustrations on his girl Kitty, shoving a grapefruit in her face and dumping her in favor of glamorous Texan Gwen Allen. Later, celebrating in an expensive night club, Tom spots their old pal Putty Nose. Tom and Matt follow him to his apartment, where Tom kills him. When Nails dies after a fall from a horse, his death precipitates a gang war. Paddy sends the gang into hiding, but Tom refuses to stay. He and Matt are ambushed by the rival gang as they leave, and Matt is killed in the shootout. Tom vows revenge and single-handedly takes on his rivals. He kills several, but he is wounded himself and collapses outside in the pouring rain. He survives, but the gang kidnaps him from the hospital and delivers his bandage-wrapped dead body to the door of his mother's house."

Skinner forbids his son Skippy to play in the pauperized Shantytown, because of the unhygienic and criminal surroundings there. But Skippy and his friend Sidney still go to Shantytown where Skippy meets a new boy named Sooky. He saves the small boy Sooky from the much bigger bully Harley Nubbins. Skippy and Sooky become friends. One day Harley accidentally breaks the windshield of his father's car with Skippy's yo-yo. Harley, who has a very aggressive and brute father, blames it on Skippy and Sooky. Mr. Nubbins, who works as a dog catcher, takes Sooky's dog and demands that they pay him for the damages if they want their dog back. The boys gather three dollars by breaking Skippy's savings bank, but Mr. Nubbins accepts it only for his windshield. He gives them three days to get another three dollars for a dog license and he threatens that he'll kill their dog if they don't get the money.Sooky and Skippy spend the next two days selling bottles, lemonade and wood, and staging a performance to earn money. Skippy's father doesn't want to lend them the remaining thirty cents. Then Mr. Nubbins kills their dog and Skippy blames his father for it. The next morning, Skippy gets a new bicycle from his father. But he trades the bicycle to his friend, Eloise (Mitzi Green), for her new dog. Skippy takes the dog to Sooky. Dr. Skinner has a change of heart and buys Sooky a licensed dog, finds his mother a job, and refrains from ordering Shantytown destroyed, instead offering assistance to its citizens. For the first time, Dr. Skinner plays with Skippy in Shantytown. There they accidentally break Mr. Nubbins' new windshield. Dr. Skinner wins a fight against Mr. Nubbins and shows that he is a good father."

Myra is having trouble paying her bills, and is behind on her rent to her landlady Mrs. Hobley. Roy Cronin, a Canadian soldier, falls in love with Myra, whom he meets during a German bombing raid on Waterloo Bridge during WW I. Roy does not know about Myra's current profession. Thinking she is still working as a chorus girl on the stage, he proposes to her, and takes her to meet his mother, sister, and step-father. Myra confesses her past to Roy's mother, and decides she cannot marry him due to their differences in social situations. She flees Roy's home and tries to avoid seeing Roy again. He comes to her apartment, finds out her true profession from her landlady, and pays her back rent, plus two weeks in advance. Roy finds Myra on the bridge again, and presses her to accept his marriage proposal as he returns to the front, but minutes later she is killed by a German bomb. Remade in 1940 with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor."

        "sinopsis": "Charlie Chan, of the Honolulu police, and Inspector Fife of Scotland Yard tour the offices of the New York Police Department with Inspector Flannery, in order to study New York police methods. While dining at a Chinese restaurant, Fife receives a phone call informing him that Sir Lionel Grey, former chief of Scotland Yard, has dropped dead in the offices of Barry Kirk in Wall Street, which was his base of operations. Fife, Flannery and Chan go to the crime scene, and Kirk informs the group that, before his death, Grey was about to solve a big murder case and had invited several guests to a party; he had left the party to take a phone call in Kirk's office and then died mysteriously.The doctor assures the group that Grey died of a heart attack, but Chan notices a dead cat in the room and surmises that the same substance killed them both and that Grey was indeed murdered. The assembled guests are queried, and all seem to be hiding something. In the office, the police discover that the safe has been robbed -- a possible motive for the crime -- and learn that John R. Douglas, a chemical manufacturer, had made the last phone call to Grey. Chan decides to stay on for the investigation.At a café, Shirley Marlowe meets with John, and he tells her that Grey demanded to know the whereabouts of an Alan Raleigh and threatened to take Shirley, Raleigh's former lover, back to England as an accessory to murder if John would not give the information. John then asks Shirley to marry him. After an interview with one of the assembled guests, Chan is led to Shirley, who confesses to Chan that she fell in love with Raleigh before she discovered the crime that he had committed, which Grey was investigating. When informed, Shirley fled, and she has been pursued by Scotland Yard ever since. Chan promises to keep Shirley's secret and goes to find Li Gung, Raleigh's houseboy.Back at Kirk's office, it is revealed to Kenneth Dunwood, another guest on the night of the murder, and Kirk that gas masks were found at John's chemical factory, which implicates John. Shirley sends a letter to Chan, indicating her plan to tell the police everything. As Shirley prepares to go to the station, an unidentified man drops a gas bomb in her car in an attempt to poison her, but the bomb kills her chauffeur instead.At the station, John is brought in, and he denies his acquaintance with Shirley until she tells him that she's confessed everything. He informs the group that he saw a \"Chinaman\" enter the building with a basket the day he met with Grey. Chan goes again to Li Gung's home, and the former houseboy tries to kill him with a cleverly designed hidden gun, but a black cat upsets the setup, and the gun shoots Li Gung instead.At the check-in room of the Cosmopolitan Club, Chan discovers Grey's briefcase, which he ascertains from the register was checked in after the murder. He calls Fife and Flannery to watch with him who retrieves it, and the trio are surprised to see Kirk claim the important item. At Kirk's office, the crime solving trio wait with the members of the original party, plus Shirley. When Kirk arrives, Flannery instructs him to answer the door and pretend to be alone. Dunwood enters and thanks Kirk for getting his briefcase. Kirk asks Dunwood when he got his membership card to the club, and it is revealed that Dunwood had not been to the club that day as he had said, but had dropped the case off just after the murder. Shirley identifies Dunwood as Alan Raleigh, and Dunwood grabs Chan's unloaded gun and covers the group, but Chan quickly subdues him. The lovers, John and Shirley, embrace as Fife announces that Scotland Yard will close the case. The men shake hands and Flannery commends Chan on his crime-solving brilliance."

        "summary": "Dr. Jekyll faces horrible consequences when he lets his dark side run wild with a potion that transforms him into the animalistic Mr. Hyde.",
        "sinopsis": "Dr. Henry Jekyll (pronounced \"jeekle\") (Fredric March), a kind English doctor in Victorian London, is playing the organ when his butler, Poole (Edgar Norton), reminds him that he has a 3 p.m. appointment to deliver an address to his colleagues and students. Jekyll calls Poole a necessary nuisance, then puts on his cape and top hat, and grabs his cane before stepping into a horse drawn carriage.Jekyll is led into a large room, with tiered seating, and a lectern at the front. Every seat is filled with men anxious to hear what he has to say. Jekyll begins by offering his view that the fog of London has clouded the minds of it's people, in that they cannot see the potential of science to free men's souls. It is the soul of men, the human psyche, that he has been obsessed with studying. He has concluded that man does not possess a single soul, but two. One is good, the other is bad, or evil, and we are all involved in an eternal struggle over which of the two will prevail. Jekyll believes that if we could eliminate the evil soul, then there would be unlimited potential for good in the world. He said he has been experimenting with how to do that, and he claims to be very close.As the lecture ends and the audience leaves, most of them are very skeptical and dismissive of Jekyll's claims. As for Jekyll, he goes from the lecture hall to a hospital where he checks on his indigent patients in the \"Free Ward.\" He encourages one young girl on crutches to throw down the crutches and walk. She doesn't believe she can, but when she tries, she is successful. Jekyll believes that demonstrates the power of the mind. Another patient, Mrs. Lucas, is in need of an operation, which Jekyll patiently, and with empathy, convinces her to have. He does the operation himself, resulting in his missing a previously scheduled dinner with his fiance, her father, and many invited guests.After completing the operation on Mrs. Lucas, Jekyll hurries over to the home of Brigadier General Sir Danvers Carew (Halliwell Hobbes), and his daughter Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart). Muriel is Jekyll's fiancé. General Carew tells Jekyll that in 40 years, he'd never been late for a dinner, and he didn't understand why Jekyll was. Jekyll just compliments the general on his reliability.Jekyll and Muriel escape the after dinner dancing to go outside on the patio and discuss their marriage plans. Jekyll tells her that he doesn't want to wait, that he wants to get married immediately. Muriel empathizes and tells him she'd like to get married soon too, but she can't go against her father's wishes. Jekyll tries to convince her of the depth of his love, telling her that his scientific work used to be the force that drew him to delve into the unknown in life, but now it's her eyes, and her face. They embrace and kiss until Carew's butler, Hobson (G.L. McDonnell) comes and tells Muriel that people are asking for her.Jekyll basically pleads with the general to approve an earlier marriage for him and Muriel, that he doesn't want to have to wait for eight months. The general tells Jekyll that he set that date because it's the same date that he married his wife, and he had to wait five years to marry her. He won't change his mind. Jekyll leaves the house with his friend, Dr. Lanyon (Holmes Herbert), furious at General Carew and referring to him as \"the old walrus.\" He then speaks to Lanyon about how there should be no boundaries to science or life.There's a disturbance nearby as a man is attacking a woman outside a boarding house, knocking her to the ground. Jekyll hurries over and pushes the man away, then bends over to assist the woman. She seems to be hurt, so he picks her up and asks a bystander where her room is. He then carries her up to her room and puts her on her bed. The woman, Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins), works at a nearby musical hall, singing and otherwise providing entertainment to the male patrons. She is astonished that this handsome stranger should be so concerned and attentive towards her. Jekyll is obviously aware of her charms, as well, and he rests his hand on her leg (which was bruised), while suggesting that she should not wear her garters so tight.He is about to leave, when she complains about her ribs hurting. He checks her side and tells her she'd be fine, advising her to get into her bed. So, after telling him to turn away, she strips all of her clothes off, teasing him by flinging her garters at him, then gets into her bed. As Jekyll approaches to say goodnight, she grabs him, drawing him towards her and kissing him. He doesn't try to pull away. At that moment, Dr. Lanyon walks into the room and is shocked at what he sees. Jekyll stands up and tells Ivy that her kiss will serve to pay his fee. She implores him to come back soon.As they walk away, Lanyon chastises Jekyll, telling him he's disgusted by Jekyll's behavior. Jekyll doesn't seem ashamed, nor does he apologize. He simply takes advantage of the moment as another opportunity to emphasize the two competing natures of man, good and evil. Jekyll does admit to Lanyon that he longs to be \"clean\" in his life, both inside and out.Back home in his basement laboratory, Jekyll is smoking a pipe and sorting through various vials of chemicals on a table. Poole comes in and expresses his concern that Jekyll has not been eating or sleeping for several days. Jekyll waves off the concern and continues working. After Poole leaves, Jekyll mixes several of the chemicals together in a glass beaker, until he's satisfied that it's the right combination. He then rushes up the stairs and locks the door to the lab before returning to his task. He writes an \"if I die\" note to Muriel, explaining that he's doing what he's about to do in the name of science.Jekyll then drinks the concoction he'd prepared, and it almost immediately affects him. He grabs at his throat and becomes dizzy. He experiences flashbacks to recent events and conversations pertaining to his work, and his engagement to Muriel. Jekyll's physical features change dramatically, as his hair becomes bristly, his eyebrows thicken, his nostrils flare, and his teeth enlarge and protrude. He utters a maniacal laugh, as he suddenly feels powerful and free of inhibitions.Jekyll starts to put on a coat and hat so he can go outside, but right then Poole pounds on the lab door, wanting to know if everything is all right. He heard noises. It's Hyde who answers in a gruff voice, further worrying Poole that something may be wrong. Hyde hurriedly prepares another concoction and drinks it, reversing the effects of the first drink and returning him to his Jekyll form. He then opens the lab door and explains to Poole that what he'd heard was a friend of his, and that the man had left through the back door.Muriel tells Jekyll that she and her father are taking a trip to Bath for a week or so. Jekyll is upset, as he doesn't want to be away from her for any length of time. He again attempts to persuade her to marry him now, with or without her father's permission. She wants to, but she won't risk alienating her father's affections.Jekyll later receives a letter from Muriel advising him that she and her father will remain in Bath for an entire month. Jekyll is not happy. His man Poole suggests he go to London to take advantage of the many entertainment opportunities there for a man of his youth and desires. Jekyll refuses, believing that he must behave himself, to prove himself worthy of Muriel and her father. However, that doesn't necessarily pertain to Hyde, so Jekyll decides to partake of his concoction again. He goes about mixing it up, taking a few drops of this and a dash of that (it's not at all precise), then he drinks it. He grunts, groans, chokes, and grimaces as his body and mind undergo the tortuous transformation.This time, Hyde does make it outside, where it's raining and the streets are abandoned. Hyde pauses to remove his hat and turns his face up, into the falling rain, relishing the feel of it. He puts his hat back on and heads straight to Diadem Court in Soho, where Ivy lives. Ivy's landlord, Mrs. Hawkins (Tempe Pigott), does not like Hyde being there and wants him to leave. She informs Hyde that Ivy is working at the music hall, so Hyde hurries over there.Hyde bumps into a man at the entrance to the music hall and glares at him, daring him to take issue with the encounter. The man shies away. Hyde then makes his way inside and takes an empty table located in a little alcove above the main floor. He orders a bottle of champagne and scans the floor for Ivy. The waiter pours some champagne, and sets the bottle down, then waits, expecting a tip. Hyde tells him to get lost, and when the waiter mumbles something as he leaves, Hyde reaches out with his cane and trips him.Hyde spots Ivy, just as she's breaking into the song, \"Champagne Ivy Is My Name.\" Hyde sends the waiter to go invite Ivy to come over and have some wine with him. The waiter implores Ivy to go over to Hyde's table, concerned about what might happen if she refuses. So, she goes, and she's shocked by Hyde's appearance. Hyde wants her to join him in a toast to her body and beauty, so she allows him that much, but then she tries to leave. He blocks her path and tells her that a woman like her deserves nothing but the best and infers that he's in a position to give it to her. When she asks how she would get all the things he mentioned, he says, \"how do you think?\" He then tells her that he has lots of money.The male patron who was sitting with Ivy earlier in the evening comes to Hyde's table and demands that she return to sit with him. Hyde breaks the bottle of champagne and thrusts the broken end at the man, causing him to give up his claim on Ivy. Ivy tries to leave again, telling Hyde she is going home. He grabs her and tells her she can't go. He tells her, \"I want you and I get what I want. I love you. You come with me.\"Dr. Lanyon arrives at Jekyll's house to deliver a message from General Carew. The general is concerned that Jekyll is not answering Muriel's letters. Poole tells Lanyon that Jekyll isn't home and there are times when he doesn't see him for days.Mrs. Hawkins goes to see Ivy in room and tries to counsel her to stop seeing Mr. Hyde, that he's mean and no good and she needs him out of her life. Ivy tells Mrs. Hawkins that it's not as simple as that, that Mr. Hyde won't leave her alone. Hyde comes into the apartment at that moment and demands to know what Mrs. Hawkins is doing there. When she says she came for the rent, he tells her she'll get it when it's due. She says, \"yes, sir,\" and quickly leaves.Hyde demands to know what Ivy and Mrs. Hawkins were talking about. She says, \"nothing.\" Hyde fondly refers to Ivy as \"my little bird\" at first, but before long, he's referring to her as a \"trull,\" for preferring Jekyll to him. He says, \"tell me you hate me!\" She refuses. He says, \"do you love me?\" Fearing him, she says, \"yes sir.\" Hyde isn't really interested in her answers, because he knows she's terrified of him. He just takes pleasure in badgering her and forcing her to do his will.Hyde has learned that Muriel and her father are returning from Bath, so he tells Ivy that he has some bad news, he must go away for a few days. He asks if that pleases her and she says, \"no, sir.\" He knows it does, so he tells her that she belongs to him and she'd better not misbehave while he's gone. He says, \"you don't know when I'll be back.\" He then wants to know if she wants him to leave right away, if she would have him not even stay that one last night. She's shaking as she tells him she would like him to stay the night, just as he wants. He responds, \"yes, just as I want,\" and as he moves towards her and she falls onto the bed and starts crying. As Hyde puts his hand on Ivy's thigh, he observes that she ought not to wear her garters so tight, then he grabs her and kisses her.Later, Jekyll is back home, with numerous letters from Muriel sitting on the table in front of him. He realizes he needs to get control of Hyde, so he takes the key to the back door, looks at it disgustedly, and throws it across the room. He tells Poole that from now on, he'll be coming and going only through the front door. He then writes a message to Ivy and sends Poole to deliver it.Ivy is telling Mrs. Hawkins that she wishes Hyde would just go ahead and kill her, rather than continuing to torment her. Mrs. Hawkins wants her to go to the police, but Ivy said no one cares about a woman like her, so they wouldn't do anything.Ivy opens the note sent to her by Jekyll. Inside is a 50-pound note. Mrs. Hawkins encourages Ivy to go and thank Jekyll in person, and perhaps he'll also offer to help her out with regards to Mr. Hyde.Jekyll goes to see Muriel and tells her that he'd been ill, that his soul was sick. He tells her that he'd been playing with dangerous knowledge and he needed her to help him find his way back to his safer self. She is very willing to help him, but isn't sure what he's talking about. Jekyll also apologizes to the general, after which he and Muriel implore the general to consent to an earlier marriage, so they can be together and she can help Jekyll. The general says no. He tells Jekyll that he's too flighty and impatient. Muriel remains persistent, however, and the general finally relents and consents to the marriage to take place the next month.Jekyll is delirious with happiness, as he rushes home and sits down at his organ and plays a fast-paced, happy tune. His playing is short-lived, as Poole answers the door and announces that Miss Ivy Pearson was there to see him. When Ivy walks in and sees that Jekyll is the same man who tended to her that night the man was roughing her up, she is very pleasantly surprised. She returns the fifty pounds to Jekyll, telling him she cannot accept it, because it could put her at risk. She then turns away from him and reveals the whip marks across her upper back. She explains the marks were put there by a jealous and violent Mr. Hyde, and that she was so frightened of him, that she'd even tried to drown herself, but couldn't.Ivy begs Jekyll to help her deal with Mr. Hyde, and that if he wouldn't, or couldn't, then to at least give her some poison so she could kill herself. Jekyll feels horrible and consoles Ivy. He asked why she hadn't gone to the police. She explained how that could just make things worse. Ivy tells Jekyll that she's a \"looker\" and would do anything at all Jekyll would ask of her, if he'd just help her. Jekyll almost kisses her, but instead he just tells her that he would see to it that Hyde never bothers her again. She was skeptical and terrified, at first, but ultimately she believed he meant what he said.Invitations to a dinner to formally announce Jekyll's and Muriel's upcoming wedding were sent out on behalf of the general. The night of the dinner, Jekyll was on his way to the general's home, walking through a park. He pauses to watch and listen to a bird singing, and he speaks out loud to the bird, \"you are not born to die.\" As he continues to watch, a cat appears, attacking and killing the bird. That upsets Jekyll so much, he begins changing back to Hyde. He's obviously distressed as he says, \"oh, no.\"When the transformation is complete, Hyde says, \"but it is dead!\" and he slithers off to go see Ivy.Hyde quietly enters Ivy's apartment as she's having a glass of wine and feeling pretty good about things, since Jekyll was on her side now. She's horrified when she sees Hyde. Hyde tells her he knows all about her and Jekyll and shocks her by repeating things that only she and Jekyll could have known about. Hyde calls her \"my little bird\" and \"my little starling,\" as he tells her that he's her angel, that he and Jekyll are one and the same. He then puts his hands around her neck and applies pressure. She breaks away and he chases her, eventually catching her over by her bed, where he chokes her to death.Other residents of the boarding house hear the commotion in Ivy's room and when Hyde runs out, some men try to stop him, but he escapes. A policeman comes and Mrs. Hawkins tells him about Mr. Hyde. Hyde runs home, but since he no longer has a back door key, he hurries around front and bangs on the door for Poole. Poole opens the door, but then quickly slams it in Hyde's face, telling him that his master is not home.General Carew says goodbye to the last guest to leave the wedding announcement dinner, then tells Muriel that he's going to cane Jekyll the next time he sees him. He forbids Muriel to ever see or associate with Jekyll again. Muriel argues with her father, telling him she's sure that Jekyll has a good explanation for why he missed the dinner and that she wants to give him a chance to explain.Hyde goes to a bar and writes a note that he then hands to a male waiter, with directions to deliver it to Dr. Lanyon. The waiter delivers the note to Dr. Lanyon at his home. The note requests the doctor to go to Jekyll's laboratory and gather together six labeled vials of specified chemicals and bring them home, then wait for a courier to come get them.Hyde goes to Lanyon's house, telling the doctor that he was sent by Jekyll to pick up the vials. Lanyon takes Hyde into his study, where the vials on in a box, but before he turns them over, he demands that Hyde take him to see Jekyll. Hyde refuses and reaches for the box. Lanyon pulls a gun and threatens to shoot unless Hyde takes him to Jekyll. Hyde decides he'll just have to mix the drink and take it there, but he first warns Lanyon that he's about to see something transpire that he can never tell anyone about. Hyde then mixes and drinks the chemicals.Dr. Lanyon is aghast at what he witnesses, as Hyde transforms to Jekyll. Jekyll cowers before Lanyon, confessing that he's a murderer and pleading for Lanyon to help him. Lanyon isn't at all sympathetic to Jekyll's plight, telling him there would be no help or mercy coming his way. He tells Jekyll that he's under the power of the monster he created. Jekyll promises to fight that control, to never mix and drink the chemicals again, and finally, to give up Muriel.Jekyll is wracked with guilt for what Hyde has done and he prays to God for forgiveness and help. He then goes over to the general's house, where the general refuses to allow him entrance, but Muriel demands they receive Jekyll. Jekyll comes in and the general leaves the room. Jekyll tells Muriel that he's setting her free because he now is among the living damned, beyond help, that he has no soul and is perched in hell. Muriel cradles him in her lap and tries to get him to tell her what's wrong. She tells him she'll help him, no matter what it is. Jekyll kisses her, then pulls himself away and tells her it is his penance, to give her up, and he leaves.As he exits the house, Jekyll pauses at the patio door and witnesses Muriel with her head resting against her piano keyboard, sobbing. The scene upsets him so much that he once again transforms into Hyde and he quietly opens the patio door and approaches her. When he puts his hands on her waist and leans forward and kisses her on the back, she turns expectantly, thinking that Jekyll had returned. When she sees Hyde, she screams. Her screams bring Hobson and General Carew running and they engage in a scuffle with Hyde. The fight spills out onto the patio, where Hyde takes his cane to the general, striking him multiple times in the head, killing him. Hyde runs as the police arrive and give chase, blowing their whistles.Hyde gets home and into the lab, locking himself in, and quickly preparing the reverse potion so he can change back to Jekyll. Meanwhile, Dr. Lanyon is at the general's home and recognizes Jekyll's broken cane lying next to the general's body. The police head for Jekyll's house, where two of them break down the door to the lab. By then, Hyde has transformed back to Jekyll and he attempts to send them back outside and on the trail of Hyde, but Dr. Lanyon arrives and points at Jekyll and tells the police, \"that's your man.\"The police are obviously confused and skeptical, but as they consider what to do next, Jekyll begins transforming back to Hyde. He charges Lanyon, attempting to exact revenge on the doctor for betraying him, but the police turn him back. He then climbs some high shelves in the lab and brandishes a knife. One of the policeman draws a pistol and shoots Hyde before he can do anything with the knife. Hyde transforms back to Jekyll as he dies."

        "sinopsis": "It is about 1922. Sergeant James Allen is returning home by boat to New York City after having served a stint in the Army and in World War One in Europe, being awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. After taking part in a welcome home parade with fellow soldiers, he travels by train to his hometown in New Jersey.James is welcomed home by his mother, his prissy brother that is a Protestant minister, younger sister, and former boss from the factory he worked. His boss has reserved his old job as a shoe factory shipping clerk he had before joining the Army. Though it is a decent job and pays him over $50 a week, which was good money back in the early 1920's, James served in the Army Corps of Engineers and wants to do something more rewarding by building things, instead of a routine life of a desk job. Plus the war made him restless. Much to the dismay of his brother, who wants him to settle down and keep his steady job, his mother supports him and wants him to do what makes him happy and what his heart desires.James leaves his small New Jersey hometown for Boston and soon after being hired by a construction company, he is laid off. He then travels by boat to New Orleans and looks for a job at a construction site, but they are not hiring. After 4 months, James gets a temporary job driving a truck in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, but is soon laid off. He stops at a pawn shop in St. Louis attempting to get cash for his Belgian Croix De Guerre, but is rejected due to the box full of medals other former service members already pawned. He is last seen heading south. To avoid identity of the state, which was actually Georgia in the true life story of Robert Elliot Burns, it fades out around Kentucky and Tennessee on the map and James is seen walking on railroad tracks. After over a year of looking for work and taking up temporary jobs, he is now a homeless and penniless vagrant.James takes up residence in a homeless shelter in the fictional city of Stanton (a pseudonym for Atlanta) and meets a man named Pete that offers him to go for a handout at a lunch wagon for a hamburger. James heartily accepts and they go there with the owner reluctantly agreeing to give them a handout. Pete pulls a gun on the owner to rob his cash drawer and then on James forcing him to rob the $5. Pete is soon shot dead by local police. James instinctively runs from the scene, but the police arrest him.James is sentenced by the county judge 10 years imprisonment on the chain gang for the minor theft. Supposedly the diner owner either lied to the police or refused to testify for James for the incident, since he did see James forced to rob the register at the point of a gun.James is at a rural prison camp just outside of Stanton with leg shackles being attached to him by a blacksmith. At 4:20 the next morning, the guards are turning on the oil lanterns and waking up the prisoners, who are chained to their bed. James sleeps through the removal of the chains and is pushed by a guard and has his chain thrown in his face. He and the prisoners all go to eat breakfast, an abominable meal of pork fat, grease, a piece dough made out of flour and lard, and sorghum molasses, which helps make the food somewhat more tolerable. The meal is served for breakfast and dinner every single day.The black and white prisoners are separated from each other in housing and trucks that chain them drive to the worksites. The prisoners await the rising of the sun before getting to work. They are forced to chop rocks in a quarry for over 15 hours a day nonstop, with only a short restroom break with the approval of the guards and lunch break. James wipes sweat off his brow without permission from the guards and punched for it. He learns the ropes through an elderly prisoner named Bomber Wells, who injects a lot of humor into the situation. Another prisoner named Red, who is on the verge of dying from overwork, passes out and guards attempt to revive him by throwing cold water on him.It is 8:20 p.m. and the prisoners are dirty and exhausted from over 15 hours of work. The only bathing they have available is a galvanized steel tub full of water they rinse themselves in and share. James and the prisoners sit down to the same abominable meal they had for breakfast, this time enjoying it somewhat.After mealtime and at bedtime, the warden asks the guards to point out the prisoners that did not give them a good days work. Ackerman and Red are chosen. James calls the warden a skunk under his breath for wanting to whip Red, who is obviously on the verge of dying. Ackerman gets ten lashes and screaming, with his scarred and bloody back revealed. James is whipped instead of Red at least fifteen times and takes it stoically, to the admiration of the other prisoners.About one month later, prisoner Barney has now completed his sentence convincing the others they can get out alive by \"work out or die out\". Prisoner Red has also left, but in a pine box, having died from overwork. James is determined to break free from the prison, but Bomber advises him that he needs to wait weeks or even months to scout out the area and have a good plan before doing it.Several months pass and James asks a large black prisoner by the name of Sebastian to bend his shackles with a sledgehammer, while they're working on the railroad tracks. That night, James successfully pulls the shackles off. Bomber gives him $7 (almost $100 in 2013 dollars) and wishes him luck.That Monday, James asks the guard permission to \"get out here\", to use the bathroom. He takes his shackles off and makes a run for it. The guards gather up the bloodhounds and follow his trail. James conveniently finds a house with clothes on a clothesline to put on and take off his prison clothes to lose the dogs scent. He hides in a pond using a reed to breathe and is just inches away from a guard searching for him before the guard turns back.James successfully makes it to Stanton. A brief nighttime scene is seen of Atlanta's Forsyth Street with the Rialto Theater and Dixie Hotel. James is walking the streets cautiously and enters a men's clothing store for a suit and hat. Then he goes to a barber shop for a shave. A police officer enters and tells the barber there was a breakout on the chain gang. James leaves the barber shop without the police noticing him. Then he goes to a hotel to see his former fellow prisoner Barney, who has been free for the past several months. He is allegedly running a prostitution ring and offers James a comfortable bedroom, booze, and a nice lady for the night.The next day, James is enjoying a hamburger and soda at a stand near the train station. The Chief of Police makes a trip to search for him. Just as he is about to get on the train, the police are supposedly trying to catch him, but instead capture a bum nearby. As soon as he gets on the train, the porter asks for his ticket inquiring why he didn't see him and that there was an escaped prisoner search, but they didn't find him. Allegedly, the porter and another porter secretly converse that James could be the escaped prisoner, but they leave the room and nothing happens.James stops somewhere in Tennessee or Kentucky, then travels by vehicle and foot to Chicago. He applies for a menial job as a laborer at Tri State Construction, starting off at $4 a day as Allen James. After two years as a laborer, he is promoted to foreman at $7 a day.James goes to find a place for rent from a boarder, a flirtatious blonde lady by the name of Marie Woods, who is asking for $25 a month, but she lowers it to $20 and he accepts. Little does James know Marie is a scheming, manipulative sociopath that is about to make his life a living hell.James is spending his nights at home studying engineering and resisting Marie's advances. After 5 years with Tri State Construction company and promoted to Assistant Superintendent, James is about to leave the boardinghouse and tells Marie he doesn't love her, but she shows him a letter his brother wrote to him about his life on the chain gang. She promises she will never tell anybody his secret as long as he marries her.James has made well at his job pleasing his superiors with his project for building a bridge and made his way up to field superintendent. But despite that, Marie is spending all his money on booze, lavish dinners, men, and leaving the house a mess.James' boss invites his to a party dinner at the Club Chateau and he falls in love with a woman named Helen, who also likes him, but finds him a little strange and troubled.It is now 1930 and the beginning of the Great Depression. James has confessed to Marie he's in love with another woman and she continues to be a spendthrift and leave the house a mess. He wants an amicable divorce, but she refuses knowing she would lose all she has, even though he offers her what she wants. He loses it and tells her his life with her is just as bad as the chain gang and she storms out the door leaving him.The next day while at work and receiving an invitation to speak at a banquet, a detective barges in to James' office arresting him. Newspapers are on the screen about a fine citizen that has made good in Chicago being a wanted fugitive.While in jail, Allen has spoken to reporters about his life on a southern chain gang and swears by it. Chicago officials have refused his extradition back to the prison.The Chicago DA and Allen's lawyer, along with a shady Southern representative, are all in an office with the representative promising a pardon to Allen in 90 days if he voluntarily goes back to serve in a clerical job. His lawyer does not recommend it, but his girlfriend Helen says he should do it to clear his name. Allen decides to go back and the representative assures him it is a good decision he won't regret.Allen goes back to Stanton and his lawyer Ramsey is paid over $2,500 up front and tells Allen that the clerical job may not happen because of the criticism Allen made to the press about the chain gangs. The assurance of the pardon seems to be fading as wellAllen has been assigned to the Tuttle County prison camp. It turns out no promises have been kept for him and that the camp he is assigned to this time is even more harsh than the first one he was at. His old pal, Bomber Wells from the first prison, has been assigned to this one because of attempted assault on a guard at the first one. He and other fellow prisoners assure Allen there is no such thing as a pardon, but Allen remains somewhat hopeful. The next day, he and the prisoners are swinging sledgehammers with a fellow black prisoner singing \"Raise Them High\" to make the day more bearableAfter three months, the prison chairman, Lawyer Ramsey, Allen's brother, and three prison commission board members are present at a hearing about releasing Allen. Allen's brother weakly testifies he has made good despite his past, his lawyer says he's paid his part of the bargain and voluntarily returned to have his sentence commuted, but the chairman insists that the chain gang is a good character builder, crime must be punished, and that Allen made unwarranted and untrue attacks against the chain gang system. During the testimonies from Ramsey, Allen, and the chairman, all three prison commission board members sit with a glare of cold indifference on their face, making it evident they already had their minds made up before the hearing.The Reverend Allen visits James in his prison declaring the bad news he was rejected for release. Allen realizes he was lied to and that they just want revenge, but the Reverend tells him if he will be a model prisoner for nine more months, they will release him and be forced to through support of his fans.Allen perseveres and serves out his nine months. Lawyer Ramsey and the prison chairman meet with the three board members once again. Ramsey said Allen has served as a model prisoner and had letters from prominent officials and the three board members still sit with the same glare of cold indifference they did at the first hearing.Allen is in his bunk that night and by this time has grayed hair. and notified by the warden that the decision is suspended indefinitely and that he will have to serve the remainder of his sentence. Allen is beyond pained and crushed.Some time later, Allen dupes a dump truck driver at a quarry that there is a broken spring. He and Bomber hijack the truck and make a run for it. With a police car chasing them and a number of guards shooting at the truck, they use some dynamite in the truck to explode near one of the hills and slow down or stop the police car. Bomber is shot and falls out of the truck. Afterwards, Allen cuts his shackles off, then lights a bunch of dynamite and throws it at a bridge to keep the police from chasing him any further.Once again newspaper headlines flood the screen about Allen's second escape and being a hunted fugitive with the final one noting that it's been a year since his disappearance.One night, Helen pulls up in her garage and Allen calls out for her. He is now a broken and destitute man that is constantly moving from place to place and deprived of sleep just to avoid being found. Helen wants him to stay, but he insists he's still on the run and can't. He confesses he steals just to survive."

Imhotep had been mummified alive for attempting to resurrect his forbidden lover, the princess Ankh-es-en-amon. Despite the warning of his friend Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), Sir Joseph's assistant Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) reads aloud an ancient life-giving scroll the Scroll of Thoth. Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists, taking the Scroll of Thoth, and prowls Cairo seeking the modern reincarnation of Ankh-es-en-amon.10 years later, Imhotep is masquerading as a modern Egyptian named Ardath Bey. He calls upon Sir Joseph's son Frank (David Manners) and Prof. Pearson (Leonard Mudie). He shows them where to dig to find Ankh-es-en-amon's tomb. The archaeologists find the tomb, give the mummy and the treasures to the Cairo Museum, and thank Ardath Bey for the information.Imhotep encounters Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a woman bearing a striking resemblance to the Princess. Believing her to be Ankh-es-en-amon's reincarnation, he attempts to kill her, with the intention of mummifying her, resurrecting her, and making her his bride. She is saved when she remembers her past life and prays to the goddess Isis to save her. The statue of Isis raises its arm and emits a beam of light that destroys the Scroll of Thoth, thereby reducing Imhotep to dust. Frank calls Helen back to the world of the living whilst the Scroll of Thoth burns."

An unknown person with a candle is wandering about and a dead body is found. When confronted, the mysterious person claims innocence of the murder. Barton, who introduces himself as Forsythe, asks the stranger about the contents of his pockets before the shadow of a hand is shown reaching for a doorknob. The stranger, who later introduces himself as Ben, searches the dead body and finds handcuffs and a gun, which he takes.The detective returns from investigating the weird sound and finds the handcuffs that the stranger had left on the ground. A woman called Miss Ackroyd is seen through shadows crawling on the roof. After falling through the roof, she is revived and cries out for her father. She explains that her father is on the roof and that they are next door in room number 15.The bell tolls half past midnight and the dead body has disappeared. Three people arrive at the windswept house: Mr. Ackroyd, Nora (a deaf-mute) and a third person. Ben draws out the gun and accidentally shoots the governor. Mr. Ackroyd draws out a gun and asks him to search the gentlemen, Ben and Miss Ackroyd. The telegram is revealed to Mr. Ackroyd. Sheldrake retrieves the diamond necklace, which he has hidden in the upper portion of a toilet. Ben causes a commotion and is locked away with Sheldrake.Sheldrake reaches out and appears to strangle Ben, who is only feigning unconsciousness. When more members of the gang arrive, they suggest binding Miss Ackroyd and Forsythe. One of the men is Miss Ackroyd's father, a police officer, who locks away two of the thieves and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. He opens the door behind which Ben is locked away with Sheldrake, and he engages in a fistfight with Sheldrake.The other man reveals himself as Sheldrake (the supposed corpse) and frees the others. Miss Ackroyd and Forsythe are bound again. Nora reveals that she is able to speak and says \"I'm coming back.\" She returns and frees Miss Ackroyd and Doyle. Miss Ackroyd faints but recovers. Nora returns to the basement to allay the suspicions of the other thieves and to buy time for the rest to escape. They free Ben and Miss Ackroyd's father. The thieves arrive at the rail yard and board a departing freight train bound for Germany.The train departs with Ben aboard and he stumbles onto crates of wine. The thieves, after dispatching the conductor, walk to the front of the train, shoot the fireman and catch the driver as he faints. Forsythe, who failed to board the train before it departed, commandeers a bus. Ben is revealed to have the necklace. Sheldrake discovers that he does not have the necklace and the thieves fight each other. Sheldrake claims that one of them is Barton, a detective posing as a thief. A chase scene occurs on the train as the thieves go after Barton, who escapes and handcuffs Nora. Forsythe's bus races after the train. The thieves, realizing that the train is accelerating, try to find the brakes. They turn dials helplessly and notice Forsythe's bus.Despite the thieves' efforts, the train only accelerates, leaving them unable to escape. At the dock in Dover, the ferry arrives. As Forsythe watches, the train hurtles through the dock, crashes into the train on the ferry at full speed and pushes it out to sea, dragging the remaining cars into the ocean. People are rescued from the water. Doyle tells Forsythe that he is posing as Detective Barton, but Forsythe, who is actually Barton, says to Doyle, \"You can't be Barton because I am.\" All of the thieves are apprehended by the police. In the final shot, Ben reveals to Nora and Forsythe that he has the diamond necklace."

        "sinopsis": "On a stormy night in Wales, five people, Philip and Margaret Waverton, their friend Penderel, Sir William Porterhouse and his lady friend, chorus girl Gladys Perkins, whose stage name is DuCane, seek refuge in a gloomy house off the road. The denizens of the house include Horace Femm, an hysteric, his sister Rebecca, a religious fanatic, and Morgan, their scarred, brutish butler, who is a mute. At dinner, Horace confides that sometime in the past, their sister Rachel died in a mysterious fashion. As the evening progresses, the Wavertons discover the Femms' 102-year-old father in an upstairs room. Transformed by drink, Morgan pursues attractive Margaret up the stairs, where he craftily releases another brother, pyromaniac Saul, from his locked room at the top. Penderal and Gladys have fallen in love at first sight. They break the news to Sir William who, because he is still in love with his dead wife, is not very upset. Soon after, Penderal encounters the liberated Saul in one of the dark rooms. At first Saul seems to be the only sane inhabitant of the house, but he proves that he is as crazy as the rest when he tries to kill Penderal. Both men are wounded in the fight that follows. Morgan, having sobered up a little, carries the wounded Saul back to his room. After Gladys treats Penderal, dawn finally breaks and the storm is over. The five guests leave the house behind as quickly as possible and Horace cheerfully bids them goodbye, as if the events of the night had never happened."

He hears about a potentially lucrative speculation in the French franc, but hasn't the money to invest in it. When his nephew, James Medland, suddenly arrives from Australia, Willie hopes that the young man's obvious wealth will help him, but James is neither interested in investments nor in giving Willie a loan. Willie then laces James's drink with cyanide that he keeps for his photographic hobby, and steals the money from James's wallet. After burying the body in the backyard, Willie is haunted by it and even his making £30,000 on the franc speculation does not calm him. He sends his wife Annie and daughter Winnie on a holiday and stays home, reading about poisons. He begins an affair Mme. Rita Collins, who owns a local dress shop, but stops when Winnie finds out as she and her mother return a day early from their holiday. Annie soon realizes what Willie has done. Rather than turning him in, her understanding seems to ease Willie's conscience. Their life is peaceful for a while, but when Winnie tells her mother about Willie's affair and decides to stay with some upper-class friends instead of remaining at home, Annie rushes after her in a storm and becomes very ill. One day, Rita comes to the door and demands that Willie pay her five hundred pounds. Willie wants her to leave, but their voices are heard by Annie, who sneaks downstairs. Seeing Willie give Rita the money, Annie assumes that their affair is still going on and decides to kill herself. She then puts poison in her glass of orange juice and becomes gravely ill. When she dies, the doctor discovers that she has been poisoned and assumes that Willie has murdered her. Willie is then condemned to death for Annie's murder. As he is about to be hanged, a remorseful Winnie visits him, blaming herself for Annie's death. Willie, however, says that he is simply making a delayed payment for what he did in the past."

        "sinopsis": "One drop of rain falls to the ground, then more drops and finally the rain becomes heavy, filling the rain barrel. The rain falls on palm leaves and other tropical plants.We are in Pago Pago, a village in an American Samoa isle, where Marines are stationed.For residents of the village, life is simple, involving fishing.A steamer en route to another port, is temporarily quarantined there when one sailor appears to have contracted cholera. Because of the heavy rains, the ship must stay longer than anticipated. Five passengers on the boat must come ashore. They are Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston), a missionary, his wife Martha (Beulah Bondi), Dr. McPhail and his wife (Matt Moore and Kendall Lee), and Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a prostitute.The only accommodations are at a general store that doubles as a hotel, run by Joe Horn (Guy Kibbee) and his native wife (Mary Shaw). Mr. Horn is a genial and usually drunk innkeeper, who fusses, chortles, philosophizes, and who readily admits that he is escaping from America during the Prohibition years.On the boat prior to disembarking, the quartermaster receives some buddies from the Marine base, and he introduces them to Sadie, whom he had met in a Honolulu establishment of ill repute. They treat her like a friend, a comrade, not a lowly piece of scum or sexual object. Her interest is piqued by the shyest in the group, whom she names Handsome, although he is known as Sergeant Tim OHara (William Gargan). She smokes, jokes, and drinks with the guys, and asks them to take her belongings to the hotel.At the hotel, Sadie sets up her Victrola to play music and dances with Tim and others. Mrs. Davidson is annoyed at the antics of the wanton woman, and complains to Mr. Horn, but he says she is just a friendly person having fun. Mrs. Davidson then confronts the group telling them they should be ashamed to be partying up on the Sabbath. Sadie tells her to mind her own business, yet, in a spirit of compromise, moves the Victrola, music, and party into her own room.Mrs. Davidson persists in complaining about the intolerable noise to her husband. He goes to see the island governor, but is told there isnt any reason to evict the young woman, and anyway it will all stop in a few days.Dr. McPhail, who has a philosophical bent, and the innkeeper Mr. Horn have no objection to Sadie, and make mild comments in defense of her rights, but Mrs. Davidson hardens and insists that her husband put a stop to the activities in Sadies room immediately.The Reverend knocks at Sadies door and enters, shouting ensues, and the Reverend is forcibly ejected by the guys in Sadies room. She comes out and in no uncertain terms tells him to knock and wait to be invited in before he barges into a ladys private room, or else put up with what he got.Sadie Thompson, fights back like lightning whenever something or someone, like Davidson, objects to her lifestyle.The rain does not stop, the hotel guests must stay in close proximity to each other, and from time to time Sadie and the Reverend meet. When only the two of them are present, he talks calmly to her at first, almost sympathetically, because his pastoral duty is to convert sinners, not hate them. Again, at first, she responds well, saying she is sorry to make trouble, and wants to be a good person. But in repeated opportunities their initially respectful conversation turns ugly as he makes demands for an instant, complete turnaround in her behavior. Davidson finds is that his religious persistence annoys her and that Sadie can be as demanding and powerful as he in her responses.The Reverends frustration, amplified by his wifes entreaties, convince him to go back to the governor and threaten him with consequences if he doesnt get rid of Sadie, as the missionary claims to have powerful connections back in Washington.The governor, a weak man, as the Reverend describes him, acquiesces and orders Sadie deported back to San Francisco on the next available ship.Meantime, Tim has fallen in love with Sadie and talks to her about having a future together in Sydney, despite his knowledge of her past. He describes to her how one of his best buddies has married and has a family with a girl who used to work at the same establishment as Sadie, back in Honolulu. As that couple initially met \"illegally\", seeing each other at their worst, they can now appreciate seeing each other at their best.As Sadie has continued to meet with Tim and some of his buddies, and not given up music or dancing or drinking and smoking, the Reverend makes a formal complaint to the military authorities about Tim having attacked him, and Tim is sent to the brig.Sadie is fearful of being sent back to San Francisco, and is without support from Tim, so she weakens and returns to talk to the Reverend, pleading with him to let her wait for another ship a few days more and go to Sydney instead.The Reverend keeps asking her questions, and changes his emphasis somewhat, talking to her about Gods infinite love and forgiveness and the need for repentance about the past, rather than her current behavior, and he begins to have an influence on her. She eventually admits to him that she is wanted in San Francisco for crimes that she did not commit, but was framed for. But the Reverend keeps talking to her about how one must accept suffering, even if unjust, even if she is innocent, because of past sins unrelated to her conviction.She begs Davidson to allow her to remain on the island a few more days; her plan is to flee to Sydney instead.Sadie convinces Dr. MacPhail to try to intercede in her behalf, first with Davidson, then with the governor, but both intercessions are in vain.She confronts Davidson again, not listening to his sermonizing, and yells back at him with such vehemence that he begins to pray out loud instead of listening to her or answering her. As he gets louder and repeats the Lords prayer as a hypnotic incantation, she begins to repeat some of the words, starting with forgive us our trespasses. With each new repetition she learns and repeats more words of the prayer, until she is saying the whole prayer along with him.Soon, Sadie has become another woman through the influence of Davidson and the effect of his prayers. She repents of her old life and is disposed to travel to San Francisco and accept the punishment of the law in expiation for her sins. Davidson feels he has succeeded in saving Sadie's immortal soul by cleansing her from her sins.Eventually Sgt. O'Hara gets out of the brig and comes looking for Sadie. The soldier cannot believe the transformation in Sadie.The \"reformed\" Sadie is much more beautiful with less makeup and a classical dress than the lurid Sadie, yet Tim believes her spirit is broken, that she is a mere shell of her former self. He tries to persuade her to go away with him, rather than return to the U.S. to \"pay for her sins\" as the missionary has convinced her she must, but she is fully under Davidson's spell and refuses.Finally the Golden Gate steamer to San Francisco arrives, and Sadies last evening in the island is in course.The natives are dancing their Polynesian music and their drums emphasize the sensual nature of life in the tropics. Lolling indolently, Joe Horn reads out loud to Dr. McPhail from a small book something that sounds like Ecclesiastes-- for a moment, we nearly believe that Davidson has converted him, too. Then, finishing the passage, he intones, \"Thus spoke Zarathustra.... Good old Nietzsche!\"Meantime, Davidson feels strong emotions at the prospect of being separated from Sadie, and finds himself being led into unfamiliar temptations. He seeks her out and, without using his preaching oratorical style, tells her she need not go to San Francisco after all, and for the first time we see him holding her by her upper arms. He is telling her in a hypnotic voice, over the native drums in the background, that she is now \"radiant, beautiful, one of the daughters of the King\", a moment of sheer unearthly poetry that verges on psychosis, and we believe him. However, she refuses to accept any new plan, and rejects his suggestion that she stay behind, saying she is looking forward to atoning for her sins by her suffering an unjust sentence.Stung by his loss of control over her, he first prays alone, then his face suddenly resolves into a look of predatory lust just before slipping into her room, with the drums implacably beating in the background.The next morning, the fishermen are pulling their nets, and find a dead body in it. It is Davidson, a suicide.The natives first scramble everywhere passing the news, which gets to Dr. McPhail and Horn. They argue as to which of them should go tell Mrs. Davidson.Meantime, Tim has heard the news and comes looking for Sadie. As they approach her door, they hear the jazzy music playing onn the Victrola. When they knock at her door and she appears, she is dressed like the old Sadie, net stockings and high heels and full of bracelets. During the night she found out for sure that Davidson was a total hypocrite, so Sadie switches back to her old self. In spite of being shocked at his suicide, she tells Tim she will to go off to Sydney with him to start a new life.As she leaves the hotel with Tim, they come upon Mrs. Davidson, who tells her humbly, You were right about him, after all."

        "summary": "Believing that an unexpected inheritance will bring them happiness, a married couple instead finds their relationship strained to the breaking point.",
        "sinopsis": "In the amusing opening sequence, in silent movie style, the routine and regimented activities of Fred Hill (Henry Kendall) at work and his navigating the rush hour going home are choreographed to a musical score. The long rows of desks, the masses going down stairs at exactly 6 PM, the crowd of bowler hats, the umbrellas, the crushing indignities of transportation in the underground are highlighted. Fred annoys many around him as he ineptly tries to read a newspaper.Fred and his wife Emily (Joan Barry), are an average couple living a boring middle class life in London. Emily prepares steak and kidney pie every other day, and sews clothes on the dining room table to economize. He begrudges their lot while she accepts it. Their black cat believes his rightfully place is atop the dining room table, and Fred shoos him down with repeated annoyance.One day they receive a letter from an uncle, announcing they will receive a small fortune as an advance against a future inheritance. They believe that the unexpected extra money will bring them happiness. Fred takes leave from his job as a clerk and they leave on a rich people's world cruise.Fred first shows his susceptibility to sea sickness while crossing the English Channel.In Paris, the two go sightseeing. A montage of famous landmarks is shown with their heads flipping suddenly from left to right over and over.Both are scandalized by the topless women dancers at the Folies Bergère. Both of them drink too much. As they ride the hotel elevator, Fred sets his watch to agree with the floor number dial, and is very puzzled by the quick changes in the number. As he is about to get into bed, he stumbles and falls on his knees in a night prayer position.After sailing out of Marseilles they at first enjoy a cruise life: drinks, dancing, pool and deck games, strolling on the decks. However, Fred's sea sickness interferes day after day. When a steward enters the stateroom to offer him food, he is so nauseous the menu item names jump out at him.Comedy relief is provided by a spinster with thick glasses (Elsie Randolph) in search of a man, any man about the cruise ship, oblivious to how she is constantly making a fool of herself. (Hitchcock often features a plain-looking woman in glasses in his films.)Commander Gordon (Percy Marmont), a dapper, popular bachelor initiates conversations with Emily to get away from the spinster. Emily finds it easy to talk to Gordon. They soon talk about the characteristics of love and marriage. Gordon has never been in love. Emily says she finds it difficult to talk to Fred because she fears displeasing him with what she says, because she loves him so much. Gordon shows Emily photographs of himself sitting next to an empty chair in his house near Singapore. Emily draws a cartoon of herself sitting in the empty chair.Finally feeling well enough to appear on deck, Fred is immediately smitten with a German \"princess\" (Betty Amann) who meets him while retrieving the rope ring used to play deck tennis.The affairs developing are shown by increasingly pairing the lovers together in one shot, and how they sightsee separately in Port Said.Emily and Gordon's first kiss is broken by the abrupt stop of accordion music being played on the deck below as an argument breaks out.In an intensely awkward scene, Fred tries to kiss the princess, who is wearing a harem costume, and he can't figure out how to get around the veil covering her face.After Fred agrees to meet the Princess in stateroom 19, all numbers he sees turn into 19 in huge sizes.As the ship arrives in Singapore, each plans to abandon the marriage to run off with a newfound love.The collapse of the marriage is symbolized when the couple are riding in rickshaws going in opposite directions, get wedged together so that neither can proceed, and neither is willing to make way for the other.Emily leaves with Gordon for his nearby home. Gordon offers her a decent life, saying outright that her husband is hopeless and that she and Fred are horrible together.When Gordon reports that the Princess is a con artist, the daughter of a Berlin laundry owner, a common adventuress who often undertakes to relieve wealthy men of their money, Emily realizes she wants to protect Fred, because he's such an impractical wimp, and returns to Fred in his hotel room, where she finds the Princess and Fred preparing to leave for Burma.The Princess leaves the room after telling Emily that she's stupid not to leave Fred for Gordon.Fred and Emily take some time to try to talk things through. Fred's frustration is taken out multiple times on the janitor who enters the room to clean, by screaming at him to get out.Fred is told the Princess is a fake, a fact that is confirmed soon after. She has embezzled 1000 pounds from him and taken off for Burma alone. Warning Emily not to tell him, \"I told you so\", he advises her not to rub it in.Emily gets a touching farewell letter from Gordon, and the letter blurs out of focus as her eyes fill with tears.The couple are left with barely enough money to pay their hotel bill and to book passage home on a cheap tramp steamer.The ship suffers an at-sea collision while they sleep.In a scene shot entirely within the stateroom, they hear the collision noise, Fred is knocked out, and while Emily tends to Fred, shouts of \"Abandon Ship!\" are heard, followed by loud thumping noises of people running and scrambling onto lifeboats. When Fred recovers consciousness, they find their stateroom door is jammed tight, they can't leave, and no one pays attention to their knocks and cries for help. The sounds recede, the power goes off, water levels are slowly rising, they hug to comfort each other, and resign themselves to die together, vowing that they both were each others great love in life, after all.At first light, the ship has pitched somewhat so they see they can exit by the porthole, and find the ship derelict and drifting, the other survivors having all been rescued.They're in their night clothes, so they find in another stateroom something to put on, \"in case somebody comes\". They step over a dead crew member, find a brandy bottle and gulp down a drink. A black cat exits to the outer deck in front of them. Further sinking seems inevitable, so Emily talks about what to do: \"Perhaps we should find a raft or something.\" Soon they sight a Chinese junk approaching.The Chinese crew of the junk boards quickly and begins to search for stuff that can be salvaged, paying scant attention to Fred and Emily, who transfer into the junk.Only a few moments later, the steamer gives a shake and a lurch, a warning that it may sink at any minute. The Chinese crewmen quickly abandon the steamer, transferring to the junk only the black cat and a few items, then slowly retreat from the sinking ship.One sailor, in the mad scramble, gets one foot caught in a rope, and dangles head down, attached to the sinking ship, and drowns while Fred, Emily and his comrades watch in helpless fascination. The large ship goes down.The junk's cook, a very pregnant woman, brings two bowls with food to Fred and Emily, which they first try to eat with chopsticks. They find the dish tasty and wolf it down one handful at a time. After they finish, they notice a black cat's pelt being stretched out to dry. They realize they've inadvertently eaten the cat!Some time later, they hear baby cries and see a group gathered at the kitchen door, so they figure the cook's baby has been born. The man who seems to be the father carries the crying baby in his arms and bathes it by simply pouring a bucket of cold sea water over it. Emily's maternal instincts are aroused and she becomes indignant at the rough treatment. \"Leave them alone,\" advises Fred, \"The Chinese breed like devils anyway.\"After several days aboard the junk, they approach land.They enter their old apartment, together and happy. Steak and kidney pudding and an ordinary life should do just fine from now on. Fred has really changed, since he takes the black cat down from the dinner table affectionately.In the last shot, the pair are seen arguing in a manner reminiscent of the scene prior to the arrival of the uncle's letter, only it is SHE who wants changes, like a bigger house, and HE is satisfied with the status quo."

        "sinopsis": "The film opens with a statement that the film is an indictment of gang rule and a call to the individual to do something about it since the government is your government. On 22nd Street in Chicago, a gentleman is cleaning up a club where some men who are hanging out are discussing the fact that Johnny Lovo is looking for some action on the south side. This man is \"Big Louis\" who has done well for himself. He makes a phone call in a phone booth. A shadowy figure comes in from the right and guns him down, wipes his gun and leaves. The man cleaning up the club puts on his jacket and leaves to avoid any complications.A newspaper editor is putting out a story that \"Big\" Louis Costello has been killed, and that this is the beginning of a gang war. He was the last of the older generation of gangsters. He wants \"gang war\" in the lead copy.Some cops (led by Guarino) (C. Henry Gordon) come to a barbershop. and the barber hides a man's gun under a towel. The man, Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), makes sarcastic jokes with the police and lights a match off of the policeman's badge as a sign of disrespect. The cop punches him and places him under arrest. Down at the police station someone reads off Tony's police record, showing us that Tony Camonte is currently strong arm for Louis Costilo (Harry J. Vejar). Johnny Lovo split with \"Big\" Louis. Tony was seen with Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) in a barber shop and what was he up to? He is released on habeus corpus by his lawyer, Fleming. He then visits Johnny Lovo. Johnny Lovo has a girlfriend named Poppy (Karen Morley) who is flippant with the two men. Johnny gives Tony some cash and tells him he's in for a raise as they move in on the south side. Tony want's to move in on O'Hara, a big deal on the north side but Johnny tells Tony to forget about having ideas of his own and to forget the north side. Johnny wants to wait until after Louis' funeral to have a meeting about running beer on the south side.Tony is paying someone off for an easy job about listening to a gun go off. He expresses disrespect of Johnny Lovo, and claims he will run the whole thing himself someday. He isn't intimidated by the north side, after all, why didn't they take out Big Louis first? there's only one rule; \"Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it\"Tony is eating dinner at home. He is not happy his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) is not home. He then catches her making out with a guy inside the front door. He doesn't approve of her hanging out with guys, and offers her cash to have some fun with. She delightedly accepts, but mother warns her that Tony gives nothing away for free, the money is bad, and she will eventually get mixed up in some of Tony's business. She tells her mother not to worry, and that she will run her own life and be ok. She flips some money to a barrel organ player with a monkey on the street.Tony and Johnny and crew smash their way into dead Louis' club and take over. The start shaking down the local speakeasy and pigden joints and overselling their beer and telling them not to worry about Meehan and Berzini. There's a shootup at \"the Shamrock\". where presumably they took care of Meehan and Berzini. This should lock up the south side. But the newspaper indicates Meehan will live. They go to the hospital with flowers and gun down Meehan.A prop calander indicates the passing of a few months. Tony hits on Poppy again. She is charmed, but tells him to go get a girl. Johnny is mad that Tony took out a north side place because O'Hara is likely to come out and kill them. Just then on the street \"Keech\" is thrown out of a car with a message to \"Stay out of the north side\" pinned on him.Back at Tony's house, Camonte's dim-witted \"secretary\" or right hand man is putting on a hat, gets a call but doesn't get the name of who called. He banters with Tony about his inability to get the name of the caller. He gets a call again and it is not clear who it was. A man comes in with a carnation implying that he has done something to someone at a flower shop. The intercom buzzes, the dumb secretary again does not get the name. Tony takes it, it turns out to be Poppy who is waiting to come in. Tony removes the carnation to remove any connection to the flower shop hit. The man leaves and Poppy comes in. He gives the carnation to Poppy who says O'Hara was killed in a flower shop in the morning. He shows her his place with steal shutters. She notices he has an expensive bathrobe on. He's got a pile of shirts so he only wears a shit once a day. He's got a mattress with inside springs. He brags about a sign outside \"Cook Tours - The World is Yours\" and says someday the world will be his. Tony makes a move on Poppy but is interrupted by the announcement of the arrival of the cops. He sends Poppy down a secret exit and sets up a date on 4th street for when he is done with the cops. Guino Renaldo (George Raft) comes in. Tony instructs him to get a message to the lawyer to get him out on habeus corpus again.Meanwhile, a British crime lord named Gaffney, (Boris Karloff) is plotting against Tony. He has just gotten an overseas shipment of Thompson sub-machine guns. One of his men calls in to say he is being tailed and Gaffney plots to get the guns moving. Tony has gotten out of the police station and goes to the restaurant. A call comes into the restaurant for Tony which the dim-witted secretary goes to get - then, in a slapstick way he is still on the phone as the restaurant he is at is plastered with bullets from drive by cars. Somehow, he is unscathed.. Tony gets his hand on a machine gun that was lost by someone in the drive by and he sees that you can carry it and sees that it could be useful. He goes to a gang hideout, orders three cars, gets into a fight with Johnny and demonstrates the machine gun. He goes and makes hits on the north side people.The cops complain there's no law against making machine guns, just owning them. They decide to harass a warehouse where they think the machine guns are coming in. There are more hits with car accidents resulting - women screaming, chaos etc. (This is supposed to be on Valentine's day, a reference to the real life 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre.)He shoots seven men execution style. The cops have picked up Gafney who is amazed to see the seven bodies. A reporter finds Gafney in his hideout. Meanwhile the cops discuss how horrible the public's attitude to gangsters is, always being glorified. The cops try talking to the editor to keep gang violence out of the paper or otherwise complaining that the paper contributes to the problem. The editor defends the headlines and the editor makes an impassioned plea to the crowd in his office, presumably city hall types, that laws need to be passed or made tougher in order to change things and that it's in the hands of the people to fix the situation.Tony is with his men at a play where he takes an interest in Sadie Thompson, the main character in a play he is watching. He goes out for a smoke. There is one act left in the play but Tony's men have found Gafney down at the bowling alley and believe it's a setup. He reluctantly agrees to go deal with Gafney. Tony gives instructions for the hit down at the bowling alley as the secretary gets back with news about the 3rd act. Sadie ended up with the marine. Gangs of men begin to crowd around in the bowling alley and as Gafney tosses a bowling ball down the lane, machine gun fire cuts him down.Back at the Paradise nightclub, Tony and his men arrive. He spots Poppy having dinner with Johnny. He gets a chair pulled up. They both try and light Poppy's cigarette. Gunshots ring out in a scuffle a few tables away. It doesn't phase Tony at all - he's used to \"noises\". Tony's sister hits on Guino Renaldo. She does a seductve dance to entice him to dance with her but he still wants to stay away since she is Tony's sister. She goes with someone else. Tony steals Poppy out on to the dance floor from Johnny. Tony spots his sister on the floor with some guy and knocks him out. He takes her home and he has an argument where she indicates \"I'll do what I want\". It escalates. He hits her. Cesca runs into her mother's arms. The mother, who has a moral conscience, takes her upstairs to console her. Tony, who might actually feel guilty goes outside.As he gets outside, there is machine gun fire. He makes it to a car to escape but is followed. There is a car chase with a haze of bullets. He is gain unscathed. They go for his tires. and both cars go over an embankment. Tony has escaped to a store (Pietro's) where a man in the dark gives him some nickles to make calls for Renaldo or Lovo back at the club but they have left. He finds Renaldo with one of his girlfriends. He's suspicious Johnny Lovo put out a hit on him. He sets up a scheme where Pietro is going to call him while he is in his office claiming to be one of the guys who saw Tony get away and somehow this will give him away. This is presumably because the assumption is that Johnny wouldn't have known what members of the crew were out so he when he ducks the phone call in Tony's presence, it will give him away. It goes down as planned. After a confrontation, Johnny pleads for his life but Tony leaves having Renaldo shoot him.Tony goes to Poppy's place. He tells her about Johnny and asks her to pack her things. He points to \"Cook's Tours - The World is Yours\" again. Tony's sister visits Guino in Tony's office. She talks him into having a relationship because Tony will be away for a month. Tony takes Poppy to Florida for a month.Tony comes back from Florida. Comments are made that it's a different town then the one he left a month ago and the crowd at city hall is looking to bust him. He finds out from his mother that his sister has a place of her own and a boyfriend. Tony goes to her new place enraged.Cesca is singing what appears to be \"The Wreck Of The Old 97\" (a hit record back around the time this film was made). She and Renaldo are expressing their love for each other when Tony comes in sees Guino Renaldo and shoots him. His sister, Cesca, sobbing hysterically, explains that she really loved him and they were married yesterday. She screams that he is a butcher who kills everyone and he leaves.An order comes in for the police to arrest Tony for the killing of Guino. (The original ending starts here) The cops arrive, they shoot the secretary as he stumbles upstairs and takes a phone call while wounded. It's Poppy. He got her name, (the first time he has succeeded in getting anyone's name) and then dies. Tony mutters \"I didn't know.. I didn't know..\" while he holds the phone as a reference to his sister's marriage.Tony is holed up in his steel windowed fort and his sister comes in with a gun, poiting it at him intending to kill him. Law enforcement arrives with sirens blaring and Cesca instantly changes her mind and pleads for Tony to get away as she stops aiming the gun at him. They have a bonding moment. Tony goes into a maniacal rant that they will take them all on as he loads up a Tommy machine gun and fires outside, hiting a number of policemen and sharpshooters across the street. Stray gunfire hits Cesca in the back and she falls wounded. She pleads for Tony to hold her but it turns out he is afraid of her leaving him alone. She is disgusted that he is afraid to be alone and mutters \"Guino, Guino\" in her final moments.Just the, the police fire tear gas cartriages into the building. Tony shouts for his sister as the cops, lead by Guarino, break down the front door. Tony stumbles downstairs and aims the gun at them but they shoot first. Tony loses his gun, being shot on the hand and pleads his case to Guarino for a sort of mercy, they try to handcuff him but he runs for it outside and dies in a hail of bullets. Tony Camonte lies dead on the sidewalk when the image pans up from his body to the sign \"The World is Yours\" and the movie ends.Alternate Ending...In this version, shot to get around censors but eventually abandoned by Howard Hughes, a line between Tony and Cesca is cut, the brother/sister bonding is reduced slightly, and he is successfully handcuffed instead of dying outside in a hail of bullets. The judge reads his sentence. He is found guilty of one murder but he has done hundreds. The judge presents a sort of sermon against violence. He is given the death penalty. A quick scene of the sand bag for being tested for the hanging is shown. Tony is brought in, his legs tied together. A bag is placed over his head. the order for the trap door is given, and he hangs off-screen."

        "summary": "A timid professor inherits a large sum of money and decides to fund a terrible musical.",
        "sinopsis": "Professor Post is a solemn and unworldly Greek scholar, and when a party is proposed, he prefers to stay in and read Aristotle. His manservant worries that his master does not properly enjoy life, and he forges a paper informing the professor that he has inherited $750,000, hoping that this will encourage him to live a little.The professor is taken in, and goes off to see the world on the strength of the paper, although of course the money does not exist. At the railway station he meets some members of a song and dance troupe, the Midnight Miads, and he speaks to Pansy Peets; she says that she is a dancer, and he says, What a coincidence; you know I have made an exhaustive study of Greek dancing!As the train is leaving, Post realises that he has left a trunk on the platform, and he manages to stop the train. The railway officials remonstrate with him for stopping the train for such a matter, but Jimmy Dodge, a comedian with the troupe, intervenes on Posts behalf.When the train gets to Fishs Switch station, the troupe are disembarking; there is a bus to take them to the hotel. Post is engrossed in farewells to his new-found friends, that he fails to get back on the train in time, and he is left alone at the station. He eventually gets a lift to the town, and rejoins the troupe.But the players have no money, and a warrant server arrives to foreclose them because of unpaid debts elsewhere. However Post has some money on him, and pays off the debts, earning the performers gratitude. Nonetheless they realise it is only a postponement of the inevitable, and everyone is gloomy until Post announces that he will fund the players expenses from his own pocket. Jimmy Dodge suggests that Post takes over the running of the troupe, and Post agrees that it would be a broadening experience. No-one opposes this arrangement, and when Post announces that he must be in New York for professional reasons, they realise that they will have to locate their performances there too on Broadway.In New York Post sets up offices as a theatrical producer, but the theatre manager is critical of the abilities of the performers in general, and Pansy Peets in particular. This is too much for Post and an argument ensues, and the manager walks out. Post runs after him and returns subdued, saying that the production will proceed anyway in accordance with his own views.Later a vampish woman arrives at the office and wants to speak to Post; she says she is Eleanor Espere, the personality girl. She has heard that Post is bankrolling the production, and its obvious that she wants to get some of it. When they ask what her previous work has been, she says she worked at a place that had previously been a Speakeasy. Post corrects her grammar and says that she should says Speak Easily and Dodge says that this will do for a title for the production.She gets hired, and during rehearsals she takes the opportunity to persuade Post to pay for her apartment, and he could run up there if ever he wants a cup of tea, she says coquettishly. The naïve Post agrees because he believes it is customary in theatrical circles.Espere goes with him to his hotel room, and her object is to lure the naïve academic into marriage a meal ticket for life. She plies him with alcohol although he does not drink she says it is only fruit juice. But she gets as drunk as he does, She is unable to seduce him, however, and the following morning she tries to entrap him, first by reminding him that a gentleman who has compromised a lady must marry her, and then arranging for her brother to arrive and threaten him.Jimmy Dodge is the comedian in the troupe, and he has taken a liking to Post; and this point he comes to his rescue, changing clothes with him in a separate room and then appearing and agreeing to marry the woman which of course she refuses.Opening night on Broadway has arrived, and Dodge uses a ruse to send Dodge off to New Jersey to get him out of the way, as he knows he will be more troublesome if he is present; but Post manages to get back to the theatre. A man has come to serve a writ for unpaid debts, and he will not leave until he has seen Post. There is interplay between Pansy and Eleanor she has told Post to get rid of Pansy, but Post has discovered romantic feelings for Pansy, and he has reassured her that the incident in the hotel room meant nothing to him.The performance starts and it is embarrassingly bad; Post himself rushes on stage and corrects the players performances, and the crowd assume it is part of the act and love it. Post announces his apologies in formal classical language and this adds to the laughter; even a man who has come to serve yet another writ for debts thinks Post is a great comedian, and when Post says he is the proprietor (to whom the writ should be delivered) he just laughs.The chaos on stage intensifies and the curtain falls to general applause. The writ server is back stage and wants $10,000 which no-one has. But the theatre impresario is vastly impressed with the performance and offers a contract that will make the debt merely small change.Eleanor is looking for Post, still no doubt hoping to use her feminine allure to get her hands on some of his money, but at that moment a scenery tab is shifted and in the final scene, she sees Post in a passionate embrace with Pansy."

A board member named Giron (C. Aubrey Smith) says that the first thing that Madame Colet's husband would do would be to cut salaries in times like these. Business bores her to distraction so she says they should leave the salaries just the way they are.At a jewelry shop, Madame Colet is helped by the clerk. He shows her a purse and she says it is too much. She asks about a 125,000 franc item. She'll take it.Colet speaks to Filiba about marriage being a beautiful mistake two people make together. But with Filiba, it would be a mistake.The Major (Charles Ruggles) is turned down by the Madame as well.Filiba and the Major are waiting for Madame Colet to come down.

Madame Colet comes out of the room and goes to the Major. Her bag is missing. The Major doesn't know where it is. They make a racket in there and go out to search for it. They search the ladies room and the Major quickly comes back out. The play ends and everyone is leaving.Still at the theater, Monescu comes out of an empty room and walks down the hall. Fade to black.The Major goes into jewelry shop and wants to look at some cuff-links. Filiba is there as well. They make small talk but the Major is annoyed.Zoom in on the Countess looking at a newspaper. She lowers it and looks at Monescu. They talk about the opera. They talk about a previous incident Monescu was involved in. He remembers everything about it and gives her a kiss. He tells her everything will be alright. Prosperity is just around the corner. She gets up and says for him to read the newspaper. They see the reward amount and he ponders what he would have gotten for selling it. She tells him to return the purse for the 20,000 francs.Madame Colet is shown bags by people looking to receive the reward. She takes a phone call and says it's not the purse. A Communist idealist says he hasn't found it and insults her about spending so much on a bag. Monescu walks in and shows her the bag. She tells her butler Jacques (Robert Greig) to tell everyone to leave because the bag has been found. She asks Monescu where he found it and he tells her about a statue of Venus. That is where he found it. She says she was nowhere near the niche. They introduce each other. He lies about his identity. He gives his name as Gaston LaValle. He takes out every item just to make sure it is hers. He says he read the love letter but to not accept the Major. They speak about different make up and lipstick. The Major arrives and Monescu tells the Major she should not be seen today. The Major mistakes Monescu for a doctor.Filiba arrives and the Major asks Jacques if the bag has been found, just to make a fool out of Filiba.Monescu leaves but not before Madame Colet says she's embarrassed to offer the reward.

        "sinopsis": "NOTE: Quotes indicate text titles from silent movie.\"This story is about the strange adventures of young Allan Gray [Julian West]. His studies of devil worship and vampire terror of earlier centuries have made him a dreamer, for whom the boundary between the real and the unreal has become him...One afternoon, during one of his aimless journeys, he arrived at a lonely inn close to the village of Courtempierre...\" where he takes a room. That evening, he hears a strange chanting, goes exploring and sees a man with a horribly misshapen face. \"In the moonstruck night light and shadow, voices and faces, seemed to take on hidden meaning. Allan Gray felt the darkness take control. In vain he tried to protect himself from unspeakable terror. Fear of the intangible followed him into a restless sleep.\" Allan is awakened by a noise at his chamber door. A man enters, says only \"She must not die...do you hear?' and gives Allan a package on which is written \"To be opened after my death.\"\"What was going on? Which horrifying secret was revealing itself? One thing became clear to Allan Gray. A human soul in fear of Death cried for help--and an inner voice ordered him to follow its call.\" Again, Allan goes snooping. He finds shadows--the shadow of a man UNdigging a hole, the shadow of a man with a wooden leg, shadow dancers. He hears barking dogs and a child wailing. The village Doctor [Jan Heironimko] appears and asks Allan: \"Did you hear it? There are no children or dogs here.\" Allan leaves, and the man is joined by an old woman who gives him a bottle of poison.\"(Allan) followed the shadows and entered a park. Among the ancient trees a chateau raised its towers into the haze of summer night. The man, whom Allan Gray had seen that same night at the inn, lived here in seclusion--with only his two daughters and a few servants.\" The daughters (Gisèlle [Rena Handel] and Léone [Sybille Schmitz]) appear to be ill. The family awaits the arrival of the village Doctor. Gisèlle lies in her bed and cries out, \"The blood! The blood!\". The old man, lord of the manor [Maurice Schutz], is killed by the gun-carrying shadow. Allan is asked to stay with the family while a servant goes for the police.While he waits, Allan opens the mysterious package to find a book entitled \"The History of Vampires\" by Paul Bonnard. He reads \"...about horrendous demons called vampires. At full moon the Dead, not at peace because of terrible deeds they did while living, rise from their coffins--to suck the blood of children and young people--and prolong their own life in the land of the shadows. The Prince of Darkness is their companion, and...at night, creatures of the Abyss visit homes of the living to sow Death and Despair. Whoever falls into the hands of a vampire withers away hopelessly...a wound on the throat, as by a bite of a rat or a cat, is the mark of Damnation. Neither Doctors nor...\"As Allan reads, Giselle looks out the window to see Léone wandering across the yard. Allan and Giselle find her lifeless body and see an old woman walking away. While servants tend to the girl, Allan continues to read about vampires \"...to grow accustomed to their miserable fate--which, besides pain in the body, brings untold agony to the Soul. Therefore, like an epidemic, a vampire's craving for blood is carried over to the victim, who himself becomes a vampire and goes searching for more victims among his dear ones. Whole families, yes, whole villages, in this way have been sucked into the curse...Shadows of executed criminals are their helpers. Living people may also be forced to do their dreadful bidding. A tale from Hungary tells how a village Doctor, having sold his soul to The Evil One became the helper of a vampire--and was accomplice to a series of horrid crimes in that parish. Here, vampires...\"The Doctor arrives and determines that Léone needs blood. While Allan donates blood for a transfusion, the manservant reads from the book. \"The vampire, who had obtained complete power over its victim, tries in every possible way to drive it to suicide; for the one who takes his own life is lost for all eternity. For him, the golden gates of Heaven are closed--all hope is gone! Oh, you Devilish...the riddle of life? Who can penetrate the secrets hidden from the light of Day? Just as strange as the life of the vampires is the manner of breaking their might. These monsters, who cannot find peace, must be murdered so that persecuted Mankind may be freed from its nightmare. Many monasteries and libraries have, in their secret...how sometimes vampires have been made harmless. In the village of Kisiloba, which was haunted by a vampire in the body of an old woman, they went about it as follows. At dawn the grave was opened; they found the old one lying down, as if asleep. They drove a metal bar into her heart--and nailed her detestable soul to the crypt. She now died a true Death, and the crime, that rested over...Certain places were beset by vampires. Many years ago there was a foul epidemic in the village of Courtempierre--claiming eleven victims. Doctors gave the sickness a scientific name. Yet among men a rumour spread that a vampire was playing its game. People believed this vampire was one Marguerite Chopin [Henriette Gerard], buried in the village churchyard. All her life, Marguerite Chopin was a monster in a human body. She died without remorse, and at the hour of Death the Church refused her...\"As Allan rests from his blood donation, a voice in the background is heard saying \"Come with me. We will be one soul...one body...death is waiting.\" The manservant awakens Allan just in time for them to stop Léone from taking the poison left at her bedside by the Doctor. Léone must not die till sunrise. The Doctor escapes, but Allan follows. Allan's shadow separates from his body. He goes to the Doctor's house where he finds his own body in a coffin, and the body of Giselle tied to a bed. As Allan's shadow watches, the Doctor and his wooden-legged helper nail shut the coffin. Is this actually happening, is it a memory or perhaps a dream induced by Allan's lack of blood?Now Allan watches the manservant digging up a grave, and he goes over to help. Is it his own grave? Will he find his own body? They open the grave to find the old woman's body. As the morning sun rises, the manservant drives a stake through Marquerite Chopin's body. Léone sits up in bed. \"I feel strong,\" she says. \"My soul is free.\" The man with the wooden leg falls down the stairs and is killed. The Doctor becomes entrapped and buried in a grain elevator. Allan unties Giselle and they go home together. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

        "sinopsis": "On a typical morning, movie star Lola Burns, known to her fans as the \"Blonde Bombshell,\" is besieged by the demands of both her free-loading family and her studio's publicity department, which is headed by the incorrigible E. J. \"Space\" Hanlon. In addition, Lola is told that, because of the whims of the Hays Office, she must abandon her new film and shoot retakes for her last project, Red Dust . While frantically learning her new dialogue, Lola confronts Space about his recent spate of scandalous publicity concerning her love life. After Space glibly informs Lola that scandal is what her adoring public wants, film director Jim Brogan, a recently divorced former lover of Lola's, shows up in her dressing room, anxious to become reacquainted. During the day's shooting, Marquis Hugo, Lola's current lover, whom Space jealousy had tried to keep off the set, begins to fight with an equally jealous Brogan. By pretending to be both Hugo's and Brogan's supporter, Space ends the conflict, temporarily dispelling Lola's disapproval.That night at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub, Space arranges for Hugo to be arrested for immigration violations, but convinces Lola that he was not involved in the affair. When Lola immediately sees a newspaper headline announcing Hugo's arrest, however, she deduces Space's subterfuge and, once again, denounces him. Anxious to get Hugo out of jail, Lola, whose alcoholic father and gambling brother Junior regularly deplete her money supply, telephones Brogan and, without revealing her true intentions, asks him for a $3,000 loan. Lola then writes a letter to the studio head demanding that Space be fired. To placate the star, Space rushes to her house and, while feigning shame, tells her that as his last publicity act, he has brought a writer from the Ladies Home Companion to interview her. Touched by Space's gesture, Lola notifies the studio head to ignore her letter, then gives a \"girl-next-door\" interview to the matronly Companion writer. When the writer suggests that she might be more fulfilled if she were a mother, Lola becomes instantly obsessed with the idea of motherhood and tells Brogan, who had stopped payment on the Hugo's bail check when he learned for whom the money was intended, that she wants to marry and have babies.Terrified by the suggestion, Brogan snidely advises Lola to adopt a baby from the orphanage on a thirty-day trial basis. To Brogan's surprise, Lola takes his recommendation to heart and picks out a baby boy from the local orphanage. When Space is asked by reporters if the rumor that Lola is pregnant is true, the publicist rushes to the Burns's house in a panic. After he learns about the adoption, Space arranges for a gang of reporters as well as Hugo and his lawyer, who are suing Brogan, to converge on Lola's house at the same time that the orphanage women are to conduct their interview with the actress. In spite of her desperate attempts to convince the orphanage women that she would make a good mother, Lola's chances are sabotaged by both the untimely return of her drunken brother and the brawl that breaks out between Brogan and Hugo. Lola then overhears Space consulting with the reporters about the scandal and, in her fury, condemns not only Space, but her family and secretary as well. After announcing that she is through with pictures, Lola drops from sight but is eventually tracked to a desert resort by Space.While Space teases her with studio casting talk, Lola is romanced by Gifford Middleton, a Boston \"blue blood\" who is oblivious to her movie star status. Taken with Gifford's florid flattery, Lola accepts his marriage proposal and prepares to meet his parents the next morning. Just as her meeting with the proper Middletons begins, Lola's father and brother, having been alerted by Space as to Lola's whereabouts, arrive at the resort. While her family disarms the Middletons with their boorish behavior, a little girl asks Lola for an autograph. Shocked by their discovery that Lola is \"that actress\" around whom so much scandal has circulated, the Middletons, including Gifford, declare her unfit to be a daughter-in-law. Angry and hurt by the rejection, Lola tells Space she is returning to Hollywood to resume her career, unaware that the Middletons are stage actors who were hired by Space. Back at the movie studio, Lola embraces Space and is about to confess her love when she overhears the Middletons arguing about their acting careers outside her dressing room. Thus exposed, Space endures Lola's ensuing but loving wrath as he rides with her to the set."

        "sinopsis": "Throughout the movie, the passage of years is indicated by dates on title cards, with a Medieval cavalcade marching in the background.On New Year's Eve 1899, upper-crust couple Jane (Diana Wynyard) and Robert Marryot (Clive Brook) return to their London townhouse to keep their tradition of toasting to the new year. Jane is worried because Robert has joined the City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the Second Boer War, where Jane's brother is already fighting. The Marryots' butler, Alfred Bridges (Herbert Mundin), has joined the CIV as a private and will also be leaving soon; his wife, Ellen (Una O'Connor), and her mother, Mrs. Snapper (Tempe Pigott), are worried about what will become of Ellen and their baby, Fanny, if Alfred is killed or seriously wounded in action, but Alfred remains optimistic. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families toast to the new century.Shortly thereafter, Jane and Ellen bid emotional farewells to their husbands as they leave on the same ship. Jane's friend Margaret Harris (Irene Browne) keeps her company and supports her while Robert is away. While the two women are attending an operetta, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred return home, and the former is knighted for his services.Alfred announces that he has bought a pub with money partly provided by Robert, and that he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff celebrates Alfred's return, they receive news of the death of Queen Victoria.In 1908, Alfred has become an alcoholic and is managing the pub poorly, spending the family's rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny (Bonita Granville) are embarrassed by Alfred's behavior. Ellen carefully plans a social evening when Jane and her son Edward (John Warburton), now attending the University of Oxford, visit the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he cannot attend due to a leg injury. However, just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up at the house drunk, acts rudely, and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny. Fanny runs out onto the street; an angry Alfred goes after her, only to be run over and killed by a horse-drawn fire engine.On July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny encounter the Marryots at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she now owns the pub and she and Fanny, who has become a talented dancer and singer, are living off its proceeds. Edward has fallen in love with his childhood playmate, Edith Harris (Margaret Lindsay). The family witnesses the historic flight by Louis Blériot over the English Channel.In April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon aboard a luxurious ocean liner, revealed to be the ill-fated RMS Titanic. (The couple's death in the ship's sinking is only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.)In 1914, World War I breaks out. Robert and Joe (Frank Lawton), the Marryots' other son, both serve as officers, believing the war will be over in a few months. While on leave, Joe encounters Fanny (Ursula Jeans), whom he remembers from their childhood, performing in a nightclub. He reintroduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a Zeppelin air raid on London from the rooftop. Fanny later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love; unbeknownst to his parents, he spends most of his leave time with her. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to accept because of their class difference.Just after armistice is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's affair, visits Jane, reveals the relationship to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. Jane is surprised, but refuses to meddle in her son's personal life. As the two women argue, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle, and faints. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly and silently through armistice celebrations in Trafalgar Square.Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future."

        "sinopsis": "Brothers Amos and Dan Winterslip discuss Dan's latest amour, a shady lady named Arlene Compton of whom the moralistic Amos does not approve. Dan, the family ingrate, throws his brother out of his Honolulu house, and his sister Minerva arrives with the news that another family member, cousin John Quincy Winterslip, is being sent to Honolulu to bring her back to Boston as, in the family's opinion, she's having too much fun. Dan sobers when he sees a newspaper item about the arrival to the islands of a T. M. Brade.During a stopover in San Francisco, John's uncle Roger gives him a strongbox marked \"T. M. B.\" and instructs him to throw it into the Pacific the next day, per Dan's orders. As John is about to toss the box into the sea, he is tackled by an unidentified man who steals the box. On deck, Harry Jennison, Dan's lawyer, and Barbara, Dan's daughter, also traveling back to Honolulu, decide to marry and telegram Dan with the news. When Dan goes to see Arlene to ask that she return an emerald brooch he had given her as a gift, she lies and says that the brooch is at the jeweler's being repaired and promises to bring it to him later. That evening, the captain on the passenger ship announces a smallpox quarantine that requires the passengers to stay on board until morning.At Dan's home, Minerva finds a prowler and then discovers Dan dead in his den. Captain Hallett at the police station receives the report of the murder, and police detective Charlie Chan is woken up along with his household of several children. At the crime scene, the doctor reports that Dan has been stabbed in the heart and that his arm has been broken. Chan questions Minerva, who remembers only one identifying characteristic of the prowler: a glow-in-the-dark wristwatch with a blurred numeral two. She also tells Chan that she remembers a James Eagan of the Reef & Palm Hotel calling repeatedly the day before the murder.At the hotel, Eagan tries to leave, but Chan reminds him that he had an engagement with Dan, which he had canceled. Eagan admits that Dan insisted on seeing him the night of the murder and that the two met after 11:00 in Dan's garden. Eagan, who hadn't spoken to Dan in twenty-three years, refuses to reveal to Chan the nature of their business transaction. Carlotta, Eagan's daughter, whom John had met on the boat to Honolulu, rebukes John, who has accompanied Chan to the hotel, for questioning her father. Meanwhile, as Carlotta watches the desk of the hotel, Brade, a guest, informs her that he'll be going away for a few days. Koahla, Dan's houseboy, enters with a strongbox for Brade, but leaves when he discovers the latter's absence. Seeing Koahla hiding in some bushes on the hotel grounds, John attacks him and retrieves the box. John now gives the strongbox, which he had earlier tossed into the ocean, to Chan, but they find it empty. Chan finds Amos' dead body on the grounds of the hotel and captures a beachcomber who wears the glowing wristwatch.Later, Chan assembles all the possible suspects at Dan's house for a final meeting at which he plans to reveal the identity of the murderer. When Chan asks Brade about the box, Brade says that Dan stole jewels from his father thirty-five years earlier when Dan was a mate on his father's ship, and that he has scrimped and saved for many years for the chance to reclaim his due. When the emerald brooch, which was found at the crime scene, is produced, both Arlene and Brade claim it. Chan then produces a check for $5,000 which Dan had made out to Eagan, and when Eagan still refuses to explain his relationship with Dan, Chan tells Hallett to arrest him. Carlotta cries out at the injustice and admits that she read her father's diary, which told of an incident thirty-five years earlier in which Eagan, a young bank teller, changed Dan's South American gold into Australian currency. Eagan, being the only man alive who could identify Dan as the thief of Brade's gold, tried to blackmail him. Koahla then admits that he knew of Dan's fear of Brade and stole the box in San Francisco in order to blackmail Dan.Chan then has his son bring in Berkeley, another passenger on the boat, and claims that he is the murderer, as water and seaweed found at the scene of the crime prove that someone swam from the ship on the evening in question. Berkeley tries to make a run for it, but he is caught by Jennison, who breaks his arm in the same fashion that Dan's arm was fractured. Chan then dramatically accuses the real murderer, Jennison, and admits that Berkeley was playing an assigned role. Chan also reveals that Dan's reply to Barbara and Jennison's wedding announcement never reached Barbara and contained a warning to Jennison that unless he broke the engagement, Barbara would be disinherited and the robbery exposed despite injury to both Jennison and himself. Tan lines on Jennison's wrist reveal that he is indeed the owner of the watch, which he lost in the surf, where the beachcomber picked it up following the murder. Jennison pulls an unloaded gun from Chan's pocket, and Chan has no difficulty subduing him. The caper solved, John and Carlotta embrace contentedly in front of the Reef & Surf Hotel, as Chan and family drive by in a new car, a gift from Minerva."

        "summary": "Affluent Millicent and Oliver Jordan throw a dinner for a handful of wealthy and/or well-born acquaintances, each of whom has much to reveal.",
        "sinopsis": "One week before her next society dinner, Millicent Jordan receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe, whom she and her husband Oliver, a New York shipping magnate, had met in England the previous year, have accepted her invitation. Overjoyed by this social coup, Millicent is oblivious to Oliver's lack of enthusiasm about the dinner and her daughter Paula's preoccupation about the impending return of her fiancé, Ernest DeGraff, from Europe. While Millicent fusses about finding an \"extra man\" for her single female guest, former stage star Carlotta Vance, Oliver faces distressing news about his shipping business, which has been struck hard by the Depression. After Carlotta, a former lover of Oliver who resides in Europe, confesses to Oliver in his office that she is nearly broke and is interested in selling her stock in the Jordan Shipping Line, Oliver is visited by Dan Packard, a rough-talking, nouveau-riche mining magnate. Oliver confides in Dan about his financial struggles and asks him to take over some of his stocks until his business improves. With blustering hesitation, Dan agrees only to consider Oliver's proposition, then goes home to brag to his brassy, gold digger wife Kitty that the Jordan Line is a valuable asset that he is going to devour through crooked stock purchases. Unknown to Dan, however, Oliver has convinced Millicent to invite the Packards to her dinner, and the ill-mannered but socially ambitious Kitty eagerly has accepted. Although he at first refuses to go, Dan, who believes that he will soon be appointed to a Cabinet post, changes his mind about the dinner when he finds out that the Ferncliffes, the richest couple in England, are also invited. Also unknown to Dan, one of Millicent's other guests, Dr. Wayne Talbot, has been having an affair with Kitty while pretending to be tending to her feigned illnesses. On the eve of her dinner, Millicent, still short an extra man, telephones Larry Renault, a washed-up silent movie star, and extends him a last-minute invitation, completely unaware that Paula is having a clandestine love affair with him. At Paula's urging, Larry, a three-time divorcé and hardened alcoholic, accepts the invitation, but advises the much younger Paula to forget about him and return to Ernest. After Paula stubbornly refuses to take Larry's admonitions seriously, she is seen leaving his room by Carlotta, who is residing at the same hotel. Later that evening, Larry is visited by his agent, Max Kane, who tells him that the stage play he was planning to star in has lost its orginal producer. Max breaks the news to Larry that the play's new producer, Jo Stengel, wants another actor in the lead but is willing to consider him in a bit part. Although crushed, Larry agrees to think about the offer, then desperately sends a bellboy to pawn a few of his possessions and buy a fresh bottle of alcohol. The next day, Talbot is discovered by his wife Lucy in a compromising telephone call with Kitty and confesses that, in spite of his love for her, he is addicted to women and needs help to overcome his weakness. Talbot then is rushed to see Oliver, who has come to the doctor's office with severe chest pains. Although Talbot tries to hide his prognosis of terminal thrombosis of the heart, Oliver wisely deduces the seriousness of his illness. When he returns home, the weakened Oliver tries to explain to Millicent his need for rest, but she is too hysterical to hear because, among other minor disasters, the Ferncliffes have cancelled and are on their way to Florida. Although anxious to tell Millicent about Larry, Paula, too, is turned away by her upset mother and faces the prospect of facing Ernest alone. At the Packards, meanwhile, Kitty reveals to Dan in a fit of anger that she is having an affair. When threatened with divorce, however, Kitty tells her husband that, if he wants his Cabinet appointment instead of a career-stopping revelation from her about his crooked dealings, he must back down from his takeover of Oliver's line and treat her with more respect. Just before he is to leave for the dinner, Larry is visited by Max and Stengel and drunkenly berates Stengel for insulting him with his paltry offer. After a frustrated Max denounces him for ruining his last career chance and the hotel management asks him to leave, Larry quietly turns on his gas fireplace and commits suicide. At the ill-fated dinner, Carlotta confides in private with Paula, who is just about to break her engagement with Ernest, about Larry's demise and counsels the young woman to stay with her fiancé. At the same time, Millicent learns from Talbot about Oliver's illness. Finally awakened to her selfishness, Millicent announces to Oliver that she is ready to make sacrifices for the family and be a more attentive wife. Then, as the beleagured guests are about to go in to dinner, Dan, with prodding from Kitty, tells Oliver that he has put a stop to the \"secret\" takeover of the Jordan shipping line."

        "summary": "A woman tricks a playboy into marrying her and then tries to make him legitimately fall in love with her.",
        "sinopsis": "Two sisters and their father are in an expensive designer clothing store to purchase a wedding dress and trousseau for the younger sister Valerie Colby (Lucile Browne) who is to be married. Colonel Sam Colby (Henry Stephenson) who has suffered some financial losses, has set a limit of $5,000 total for the two sisters for their weddings and Valerie selfishly adds additional items to a total of $3,088. Her older and more mature sister Joan (Ann Harding) allows her to get away with it. Leaving the store Joan runs into wealthy playboy John Fletcher (William Powell) who had to miss out on a polo match to attend his one annual business meeting for his family's shipping line. Fletcher had given Joan a ride home in the early morning from a party the previous night and they arrange to go out again that night.\nOn the ride home Valerie warns Joan that John Fletcher is involved with another woman, Monica Paige, and is not the marrying kind. Her father is unsure of her dating 'playboy of the west', and calls him a lazy beggar because he has neglected his family's shipping business that was successful previously to play polo rather than work. Joan says that her father has given her an idea and sets out to marry John Fletcher. Joan approaches the wedding as a business arrangement, not because she is in love, but because she is ambitious to accomplish something and plans to marry a man with a future and make his future hers. Valerie is engaged to be married to Dennis Moore (George Meeker) and can't understand her sister's plan to marry without love. John Fletcher sends Joan a gardenia corsage to wear for dinner.\nAfter dinner, John and Joan end up going to his apartment as Joan had predicted to Valerie earlier. The butler Freeman is soon excused for the evening. John embraces Joan and crushes her corsage. While out for lunch at a seafood restaurant on the bay Joan notices a ship going by and engages John in a discussion of his interest in the shipping business. John has enough money to live his life of leisure. John doesn't want the business and its headaches. Joan tells John he could be a tremendous success if he chose to be.\nAfter several weeks of dating when he shows no interest in marrying her, Joan decides to force the issue. To Joan's annoyance, she finds herself falling in love with him. She arranges to call her sister Valerie and have her send her father, Colonel Colby, to find Joan in a compromising position at John's apartment. When the couple arrive at John's apartment his butler Freeman advises him that Mrs. Paige has been calling him repeatedly. Joan asks John why he hasn't married Monica Paige (Lilian Bond) and he states he has no interest in marrying her. The couple engage in light banter about marriage and John expresses that he is satisfied with their arrangement as it is. Monica drops by and attempts to talk John into going with her and some friends to the beach but John claims he is tired and declines stating he has some work to do. Monica spots Joan's hat on a chair and excuses herself. Joan who is changing in the other room places the call to her sister.\nColonel Colby arrives, is indignant and disappointed in Joan, and John graciously agrees to do the honorable gentlemanly thing and marry Joan if that's her choice. Joan tells her father she is in love with John and advises John that she does wish to marry him. The couple set out on their honeymoon cruise and while sitting on the deck John lets Joan know that he expects her to grant him a divorce after a decent interval in good sportsmanship. Joan casually suggests six months to give her time to prove their relationship.\nJoan gets John to take an interest in his family business and he finds he enjoys the work and to such an extent that he has no time for polo and his golf game is suffering. John finds that his butler is enjoying working for the married couple and that Mrs. Fletcher has shown the cook how to properly prepare his toast. Joan is reading the paper and sees an article that Monica Paige is returning to town. The Postmaster General (Wallis Clark) is a friend of her father's and Joan invites him to dinner when he is in town. Joan's plan is to land the government mail contracts for John's company. John credits his success on Joan's nagging and acknowledges that she has been instrumental in his newfound interest in the business.\nValerie has gone $1,000 into debt due to her extravagant spending habits. Joan has lent her money repeatedly. Joan tells Valerie she has given her all she can afford without touching John's money. Finally, Joan offers to pawn her mother's ring. While at lunch with her friend Eleanor Weston (Kay Hammond), they wonder why Valerie would go for lunch with Denny's friend Farley Drake (Hugh Huntley). Joan also confides that her and John are to be divorced. At the restaurant, they spot John out for lunch with Monica. Joan approaches them and invites Monica to spend the weekend at their ranch and then leaves. In the subsequent conversation with Monica John finally realizes that he loves his wife. Driving in the car with Farley, Valerie asks him as a successful financier, how she can earn $1,000. Farley offers to let her have it and Valerie confirms there are strings attached.\nJohn stops at the florists and orders a gardenia corsage for that evening's dinner party. Joan meanwhile has pawned the ring for $500 or half of what Valerie needs, but tells her that it is the last time. The spoiled Valerie is not pleased with the amount and after confirming Farley is invited for dinner, confides that he wants to make love to her. While leaving, Valerie meets John and behind Joan's tells him she needs the funds for back rent and cons him into giving her a check. Joan catches them and tears up the check and explains to John that Valerie has lied about her need for money. Both Joan and John ask Valerie to talk to Denny. In a fit of temper Valerie states she can get other men to give her the money and then blurts out how Joan had set up the plan to trap John into marriage. Joan admits that it is true and John walks out.\nDisillusioned, John goes back to Monica. Joan is waiting for them at Monica's apartment and calmly admits she is ashamed she tricked him and glad that Valerie blurted out the truth. Joan states that she believed marriage was a business and that she could be useful to him and help him. Joan goes on to admit she has fallen in love with him and thought she had a chance to win him over. Monica informs Joan that she is sailing to Europe in a week and John is going with her. Joan asks if John wants the divorce beforehand and leaves.\nJoan returns home to the planned dinner party with Valerie, Denny, her father, Eleanor and Leonard Weston, Farley Drake and the Postmaster General Oliver Lane. Valerie gets drunk and plans to admit to her husband that she had an offer from Farley. The Westons get a call about a sick child and leave to go home and Farley offers to drive them to avoid the confrontation. Joan arranges with the butler to announce that John is stuck out of town and will be late. Denny and the Colonel are out on the porch with the drunken Valerie. Only Joan and Mr. Lane are at the table for dinner and Joan is advised that the Fletcher line is to receive the government mail contract. At the last moment, John shows up and makes an excuse he had to stop to pick up the gardenias. John explains that this is their four month anniversary and the couple embrace."

        "sinopsis": "In the country of Freedonia, wealthy socialite Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) agrees to give the small country a sum of $20 million in order to save it from bankruptcy provided that Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is appointed the new leader. During the inaugural ceremony, Firefly courts the widowed Mrs. Teasdale and insults her friend Trentino (Louis Calhern), the scoundrelly ambassador of the neighboring country of Sylvania. Firefly then sings out that if Freedonians think that their country is bad off now, \"Just wait 'til I get through it with\" ('These Are the Laws of My Administration').Meanwhile, Trentino schemes with the seductive Latina singer Vera Marcal (Raquel Torres), telling her to keep Firefly out of the way while he tries to win Mrs. Teasdale's hand in marriage. Trentino also hires hot dog and peanut vendor Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Firefly's goofy and mute chauffeur Pinkie (Harpo Marx) to spy on Firefly. However, both Chicolini and Pinkie deal with a unfriendly lemonade vendor (Edgar Kennedy) off-and-on who thinks that Chicolini's peanut stand is taking away his business.Firefly presides over his cabinet. He refuses to discuss taxes or anything else that has to do with the government. He reduces workers hours by shortening their lunch breaks against the protest of his personal secretary Bob Rolland (Zeppo Marx). Next, Firefly hires Chicolini to be his secretary of war, believing he will annoy the rest of the cabinet. Firefly and Bob Rolland decide that they want to start a war with Sylvania by causing a personal feud with Trentino.At a picnic, Firefly interrupts Trentino's attempt to propose marriage to Mrs. Teasdale. When Trentino calls him an upstart, Firefly slaps him with a glove and declares war between Freedonia and Sylvania. Mrs. Teasdale arranges for the two men to make peace that night. Firefly jokingly asks Trentino what he called him earlier. When Trentino answers \"upstart\", Firefly slaps him again and once more declares war.Vera is a guest at Mrs. Teasdale's house. That same evening, she phones Trentino and tells him about her situation and that Firefly is there with Freedona's war plans for Sylvania. Trentino sends Chicolini and Pinkie to the house to steal the war plans. Chicolini locks Firefly in his bathroom and dresses up like him with eyeglasses and a fake thick greasepaint mustache and eyebrows. Pinkie also dresses up as Firefly as well. Both Chicolini and Pinkie try to fool Mrs. Teasdale into giving them the war plans. But Firefly breaks out of his bathroom and attempts to find the men impersonating him. In a famous sequence, Pinkie breaks a large mirror and mimic's Firefly's movements in what is later known as the 'Mirror Sequence'. Firefly is fooled for a time in thinking his look-alike is his reflection until Chicolini shows up and Firefly captures him, while Pinkie flees.Chicolini goes on trial, but the chaotic proceedings come to a halt when Mrs. Teasdale tells Firefly that Trentino is on his way to the courthouse to make one final effort to avoid war. Firefly agrees to apologize to Trentino for insulting him, but has second thoughts when he considers that Trentino may refuse to shake his hand of friendship. When Trentino enters, Firefly immediately slaps him instead of suffering a possible rejecting and being insulted. Trentino storms out, declaring war. Firefly, Chicolini, Pinkie and Bob Rolland all sing in chorus of the impending war ('The Country's Going To War').A 'Great War' breaks out between Freedonia and Sylvania. As Firefly receives news and orders from the front lines, an enemy artillery shell destroys part of his headquarters. He then produces a Tommy sub-machine gun but guns down many of his own men. To get new recruits, Pinkie is seen roaming the countryside and battlefields (stock footage from the battles of the first world war) carrying a placard that reads: \"Join and Army and See the Navy\".Chicolini shows up at Firefly's headquarters claiming that he just deserted from Trentino's armies and joined Freedonia because they serve better food. Mrs. Teasdale calls Firefly and claims that her house is under attack from enemy soldiers. Firefly, Chicolini, Pinkie, and Bob rush to her aid but they find themselves trapped at the house. Just when it looks like they will be defeated when enemy troops storm the house, they capture Trentino when his soldiers break into the house. The four men pellet Trentino with orange until he gives up. Firefly declares that: \"Freedonia has won the war!\" They continue to pellet the captive Trentino with oranges and other fruit. In the final shot, when the happy Mrs. Teasdale sings the Freedonia national anthem, the four men pelt her instead."

        "sinopsis": "The film opens with an airplane flying straight at the audience. Its propeller spins into the films title frame. During the opening credits each of the principal characters is introduced in a film clip from the movie that includes their real name and the character they portray. Then, the same airplane shot is seen; this time its propeller spins into a distant shot of the Hotel Hibiscus in Miami. A sign appears: Hotel Hibiscus, Roger Bond and His Yankee Clipper Band Now Playing in the Date Grove.\nMr. Hammerstein (Franklin Pangborn) inspects the hotels chefs, the bellboys and maids. Hammerstein, who has been brought from Switzerland to shape up the hotels staff, seems uncomfortable with one of the buxom maids and isn't pleased with anothers shoe heels that are terribly worn. Next, he wants to inspect the band. The head waiter (Eric Blore) points to the opposite side of the room where the band members are lounging. Honey Hale (Ginger Rogers), the bands female vocalist, greets Hammerstein with, Good morning, Popeye. He reprimands her for speaking before he has asked her a question. Then, he tells the band members that he has had several complaints about them; he is particularly upset that they have been too familiar with the guests. Hammerstein asks where Roger Bond (Gene Raymond), the bands leader, and Bonds assistant, Fred Ayres (Fred Astaire), are. Honey says, Coming right down.\nThe scene switches to a small single engine airplane doing a loop-de-loop before it lands. Once it stops, Fred is the first out; he has to hold on to the struts to keep from falling. There is a small piano in the plane right behind the front seats; Roger uses the instrument to write songs during his flights. Fred and Roger rush to the hotel for a scheduled radio program.\nAt the hotel, Hammerstein is pacing, the band is waiting on the bandstand and everybody is looking at their watches. At the last possible moment, Roger and Fred sneak in from the back of the bandstand, Roger welcomes the radio listeners and introduces their first song, Music Makes Me with a complete vocalization by the charming, bubbling, effervescent little lady, Miss Honey Hale. During the vocal break, as couples dance by, Roger makes eyes at several of the pretty women and they smile right back. Fred, who plays the accordion, warns Roger to take it easy and not get them fired. Roger zeros in on a Brazilian that is sitting at a table with several other young women. All these women show interest in Roger, but it is the Brazilian who sends him a note. He promptly turns the band over to Fred to dance with her. One of the girls at the table asks, What have these Brazilians got below the equator that we haven't?\nWhen Hammerstein sees Bond and the girl dancing together, he sends the head waiter to tell her aunt, Dona Elena de Rezende (Blanche Friderici). The head waiter passes the assignment to a waiter that the girl is dancing with a musician, who passes it to a bellboy that she is dancing with the drummer, who reports to a maid the now completely distorted message that she is dancing with a piccolo player, who announces to the aunt that her niece is involved with a gigolo. When Dona Elena finds them downstairs, she pays Roger as if he was a gigolo. He uses the money to purchase an orchid for the girl (the girls name is Belinha de Rezende, who is played by Dolores Del Rio), who gives the orchid to Hammerstein because, she says, in her country they grow like weeds. However, when Roger isn't looking, she retrieves the orchid. Hammerstein promptly fires Roger and his band.\nThe next morning, Fred joyfully announces to the band that Roger has landed them a job at the Hotel Atlântico in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe next scene shows Roger and Belinha at a writing desk composing radiograms; theres a wall between them so they don't see each other. Rogers message is addressed to Júlio Ribeiro (Raul Roulien) in Rio. It says, Thanks old pal; will bring band down in time to open new hotel. Belinha's radiogram is addressed to Carlos de Rezende (Walter Walker) at the Hotel Atlântico in Rio. It says, Father dear, sorry you are ill; we missed this weeks Rio plane, taking next. Love to Júlio. Belinha and Roger bump into each other as they make their way to send their messages. She apologizes for causing him to get fired. He is pleasantly surprised when she explains she had missed the airplane to Rio de Janeiro. He tells her he knows a friend who has a plane that could give her a ride, but it is a small plane with room for just one passenger. She is excited about the offer, so she rushes upstairs to tell her aunt. Roger informs Fred that he wont be flying down to Rio with him. Flying down to Rio, Roger says, boy, what a title for a new song.\nOf course, the friend with the airplane is Roger, who for some reason Belinha and her aunt do not recognize when they arrive at the air field. It is only after they are airborn that Roger reveals his identity by singing a couple of lines from Just a Gigolo. After dark, the planes engine has a mechanical problem, so they are forced to land on a moonlit beach for repairs. She is certain there really isn't anything wrong; it is just Rogers attempt to woo her again. Once he finds the problem, a clogged fuel line, he decides to keep it a secret. Secretly, shes excited about being marooned with him on a deserted island, but she doesn't want him to know.\nRoger crawls back into the plane to make up a new song for the occasion on his piano it works! Soon, she is in the plane with him and they are kissing. She immediately feels guilty because she is engaged (an arranged marriage). When Roger brags that her engagement wont stop him from seeing her, she slaps him then, he spanks her.\nThey spend the night there with Roger sleeping on the beach and Belinha inside the plane. The next morning, Roger wakes her, but she ignores him, so he goes exploring. When she climbs out of the plane, she sees some black men and, assuming theyre savages, screams for Roger and runs to find him. When Roger rushes to her aid, he is knocked out by something falling from the sky. When he revives, he discovers he was hit by a golf ball. They had landed near Port-au-Prince Golf Club in Haiti. The wild men Belinha saw were the clubs bellhops out for their morning swim in the ocean. The airport is a short distance away and, since the regular Rio flight had spent the night on the island, Belinha decides to take it the rest of the way. Before she leaves, she tells Roger he will find the engine part he through away, the fuel line, on top of the piano.\nThe scene shifts to Rio; the film audience views a short travelogue of the city from the air. Then, Roger tells his friend, Júlio, about the wonderful Brazilian girl he met at the Hotel Hibiscus in Miami (Roger still doesn't know her name). By Rogers description, Julio realizes he is talking about his fiance. Roger asks Júlio to help him find the girl. Fred interrupts their conversation to tell him the band is waiting downstairs to go to the Carioca Casino, an outdoor club, to hear the Turuna Band. The only thing on Rogers mind is finding the lovely tropical girl.\nDepressed by Rogers tale of his newly discovered Brazilian love, Júlio telephones Belinha wanting to see her, but she claims she is too busy. Before Roger leaves, Júlio invites him and Fred to be his guests at a dance at the Aviators Club the following night. Roger hopes hell find the girl there. He also has a new song he'd like to try out there. He demonstrates a little of Orchids in the Moonlight on the piano for Júlio and tells him he wrote it for her.\nThe next scene is the Carioca Casino, where Rogers band members have come to hear a native band, the Turunas. The crowd begs the bands leader to play The Carioca. As the song begins, the locals quickly flood the dance floor. Fred, Honey and others from the band sit at elevated tables watching and learning the dance. The primary idea of The Carioca is for the dancers to keep their foreheads together while they dance. Ginger inquires, Whats this business about the foreheads?, to which Fred answers, Mental telepathy. Gingers wisecrack reply is, I can tell what they're thinking about from here. After watching some more, Fred takes Honey by the hand and says, Lets try it, to which, Ginger replies, Well show em a thing or three. They begin dancing near the band leader, who encourages them to dance on seven white pianos which are somehow connected to form a circle. Fred and Honeys dance is exuberant, but they definitely don't keep their foreheads together all the time. The other dancers stop to watch these two talented foreigners. After a dance chorus, three different women sing the lyrics. As these singers perform, various groups dance, some of them rather erotically. As the last singer concludes, Fred and Honey join the dance again as the connected pianos begin to revolve and seven pianists begin to play. When the camera pulls back, the set is flooded with dancers, some of whom form a revolving pyramid. The next morning, a sign advertises the gala opening of the Hotel Atlântico soon and three Greek men, from a gambling syndicate in Monte Carlo, who are plotting with a local bank to take over the hotel from Senhor Rezende, are seen. Roger, Honey and Fred are walking the streets with Roger constantly looking for his lost love. Fred tries to think of something they could do that would top The Carioca, while Honey just wants to eat. Fred sees Belinha at an outdoor café with her aunt, so he sends Roger in the opposite direction. The next scene is the party at the Aviators Club. When Fred arrives, Júlio introduces him to his fiancé and her aunt. Definitely surprised, Fred heads off to intercept Roger. Belinha's father, Senhor Rezende, joins their table. The clubs band (a sextet), who are seated in the gondola of a large hot air balloon that is suspended from the ceiling, play a tango for dancing. Júlio says it is a new number being played for the first time. Belinha seems to recognize the song right away and Júlio notes her reaction. She excuses herself and wanders out onto a terrace; Júlio follows her. He mentions the romantic song the band is playing. He tells her the words are dangerously romantic and, on a tropical island, could make any woman fall for any man. He proceeds to sing Orchids in the Moonlight, the song Roger had played on the piano during his night with Belinha on the beach. Shortly after Júlio's singing is finished, Roger climbs over the terrace wall to discover the girl he has been seeking. Julio introduces her to his best friend, Roger, and introduces Roger to senhorita Rezende, his fiancé, which creates an uncomfortable situation. To get away, Belinha asks Fred, who has happened by, if this isn't their dance. While Belinha and Fred dance to a chorus singing more of Orchids in the Moonlight, Roger and Júlio decide to let nature and common sense take their courses in resolving their predicament with Belinha.\nThe three Greeks have arranged with city government officials that the Hotel Atlântico not be issued an entertainment permit so its opening will be a failure.\nWhile Fred tries to rehearse a rag-tag crew of chorus girls, the band starts playing a fast arrangement of Music Makes Me. His feet just cant resist; he starts to tap dance with both arms flailing. After a few steps, he tries to resume talking to his chorus girls, but once again, he cant resist the beat. Some policemen arrive to inform Fred that the rehearsals must stop because Senhor Rezende doesn't have an entertainment permit. Belinha, who is wearing a bathing suit, translates for Fred. Her father arrives and explains he had a permit for the original opening date, but when there was a delay, he had to get another one. Only the Mayor can issue the permit and he is mysteriously out of town. Senhor Rezende is resigned to delaying the opening again. Fred and Roger would like to help but how? Suddenly, Roger hears some airplanes above and that gives him an idea. He just has to convince the members of the Aviators Club to cooperate.\nRoger, Fred, Honey and Júlio arrive at an airfield where several of the club members and their airplanes have gathered. They convince the chorus girls to go along with their plan. They fit the planes wings with apparatus that will allow the girls to turn their floor show into an airborne extravaganza. Carlos de Rezende sends Roger a Saint Christopher statue with the following note: I send you this token which has been in my family for 433 years, in deep gratitude for your gallant efforts to save me from ruin, and to help consummate the long cherished plan of my daughters marriage to Júlio.\nPeople begin arriving for the hotels opening including Belinha and a group of American tourists from another hotel. Rogers band sneaks in with their disguised instruments.\nJust before the airplanes take off, Júlio receives a note from Roger. It tells Julio to be the lead pilot and the hero so he can impress Belinha and marry her. Roger is taking a flight to Buenos Aires.\nAs the air show begins, skywriters spell out Hotel Atlântico Presents Yankee Clippers. Seeing this, the Mayors representative warns Senhor Rezende against doing anything that would offend the authorities. The sky fills with single wings and bi-planes with twenty-two frightened chorus girls strapped to the wings.\nWhen Roger sends Belinha a message, she meets him and learns that Júlio is leading the air show and that Roger plans to go away. They say goodbye with a kiss that Júlio observes from the air with his binoculars.\nIts show time! The band unwraps their instruments and begins to play Flying Down to Rio, which is sung by Fred. Honey, who is straddling the lead plane which is piloted by Júlio, waves instructions to the rest of the girls as they perform their aerial choreography. In one sequence, some of the girls clothes are ripped off (they have on something underneath), three males toss a girl back and forth from one side of the planes wing to the other and in another a girl trapeze artist falls but is caught by one of the males on a lower aircraft. Just as the exhibition ends, the Mayor arrives and congratulates Rezende on a superb grand opening performance (the band is playing The Carioca during this sequence). The three Greeks, seen as shadows, are hit on the head with bottles by three unseen assailants. Júlio lands on a nearby beach, rushes to the hotel, grabs Belinha, tells her he is taking her on her honeymoon and drives her to the dock where a passenger seaplane (the China Clipper) is embarking. Both of them board the aircraft and Júlio deposits Belinha in a seat opposite from Rogers. Júlio gets the captain to marry Roger and Belinha and bails out of the airplane."

        "sinopsis": "The film opens during the depths of the Great Depression, with the inauguration of newly-elected President Judson C. \"Judd\" Hammond (Walter Huston). Hammond, a genial but corrupt and apathetic party hack, cares little for the pressing concerns of the day. Dismissing unemployment and bootlegging to be \"local problems\", he demonstrates more interest in playing with his nephew Jim and sleeping with his \"private secretary\", Pendie Molloy (Karen Morley), than with doing any actual work.One day, while recklessly racing his automobile, Hammond suffers a near-fatal crash, which leaves him in a coma. Though his doctors conclude that the president's death is imminent, a mysterious presence (conjectured later in the movie to be the Archangel Gabriel) revives Hammond. Uncertain of how to respond to the turn of events, Hammond's physician keeps his condition secret for weeks. When Molloy is finally permitted to see him, she finds Hammond distant and cold to her.Summoning his Cabinet, Hammond becomes an advocate of an activist government. When the Cabinet calls for the military to be deployed against an \"Army of the Unemployed\" that is marching to Washington, D.C. to demand work, he refuses, firing the Secretary of State when he threatens to resign in response. After the leader of the marchers is killed by racketeers, Hammond travels to the marchers' camp and announces the formation of an \"Army of Construction,\" a massive public works program that will give a paying job to every unemployed man in America until the economy recovers.Alarmed at Hammond's new course, his vice president and Cabinet begin plotting against him, only to receive requests for their resignation. This triggers impeachment proceedings against him in Congress, which is also corrupt and controlled by laissez-faire politicians. While in the midst of impeachment debates, Hammond appears before Congress and requests money to stimulate the economy. Facing Congressional opposition, he demands that Congress vote him extraordinary powers and to adjourn until the crisis was over. When the members of Congress denounce his request as dictatorship, Hammond threatens to declare martial law, leaving Congress little choice but to capitulate to his demands and grant him the power to enact all necessary measures, unfettered by the normal system of checks and balances. Enjoying the support of the public for his actions, Hammond outlaws foreclosures, creates federal bank insurance to protect depositors, and offers subsidies to farmers.Next, Hammond turns his attention to the problem of organized crime. Securing Congressional repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, he tells crime boss Nick Diamond (C. Henry Gordon) of his plan to open government liquor stores and encourages the immigrant mobster to return to his own country voluntarily. In response, Diamond orders the bombing of the first government liquor store and attempts to assassinate Hammond in a drive-by shooting of the White House that leaves Molloy injured. Hammond retaliates by creating a special military unit called the Federal Police, to go after Diamond. Led by Hammond's top aide, Hartley Beekman (Franchot Tone), the unit corners Diamond in a warehouse and blasts him and his men out using armored cars. \"Technicalities of the law\" are circumvented with a brief military tribunal, also led by Beekman, that ends in the execution by firing squad of Diamond and his associates.Finally, Hammond moves to collect the large unpaid war debts due from other nations from the Great War. He invites the world's ambassadors to a conference on board a yacht, where, before a worldwide radio audience, he demands repayment of the debts. When the representatives protest their inability to pay, Hammond announces his country's repudiation of the naval limitations agreement, threatening a renewed arms race as a result. Staging a display of air power for the conferees by ordering naval bombers to sink two obsolete battleships, he delivers an impassioned speech on the total destruction of humanity to come in \"the next war\" unless they choose the alternative of using military expenditures to balance their budgets and repay their debts instead. The world's leaders agree to a peace covenant, but upon adding his signature to the covenant Hammond collapses. As he lies dying, Molloy sees his face change and the old Judd Hammond returns, seeking her approval for all that he has accomplished before finally expiring."

        "summary": "An Egyptologist returns from the dead to take revenge on those who have violated his tomb.",
        "sinopsis": "The opening scene is at night in a city. A man in Egyptian fez and garb follows a suited man to his apartment building. The landlady lets the Egyptian in when he asks for a Mr. Dragore. In Dragore's room the Egyptian, Mahmoud, threatens Dragore (who is also Egyptian) with a knife. He demands a jewel, the Eternal Light. He wants to return it to the tomb from which it was stolen. Dragore says it is too late, he has sold it to a Professor Morant. They join forces to get it back.The next scene is at Professor Morlant's estate home, Eastvale. Morlant is on his death bed. He seems disfigured. A parson, Nigel Hartley, rings at the door but is abruptly turned away as he is told the professor is a pagan. The doctor comes out of the professor's bedroom after examining the professor and says to someone that he hasn't long to live and goes down stairs and talks to Morlant's solicitor, Mr. Broughton. Broughton sends the doctor across the hall to get a drink. Broughton looks in the professor's books and sees he paid 75,000 pounds for the Eternal Light, which leaves him little.Morlant asks for his manservant, Laing. He tells Laing that he wants the jewel buried with him as it will enable him to receive eternal life at the next full moon. Laing is against the idea but agrees. Morlant binds his hand with the jewel in his grip. Morlant also tells Laing to watch Broughton as he doesn't trust him. Later, Morlant dies. He is buried in a large mausoleum on the estate grounds. Someone is watching from the bushes but we can't see who. Laing removes the jewel from the professors hand and locks the tomb with the key left inside. Inside the house, Laing hides the jewel in a coffee container. He then looks up the address of a Miss Betty Morlant in the city. Miss Morlant, it turns out, is one of the professor's two heirs.Broughton leaves but tells his chauffeur, Davis, to stay behind outside and tail Laing if he leaves. Broughton seems to think Laing is going to steal the jewel. Laing now heads for \"Yoxford Station\" with Davis following.Back in the city at Broughton's office, the other heir, and Miss Morlant's cousin, Ralph Morlant learns that his uncle is almost penniless except for his house. Ralph decides to meet Betty and then go to Eastvale against Broughton's wishes.That night, Laing meets Betty in the street and hands her a note which she reads and then puts in her purse. The note says \"There is something of value at Eastvale and others are after it. Come quickly.\" Almost immediately the purse is stolen by Broughton (it's dark and she doesn't see who the thief was) and the note torn up, but the Aga has been loitering outside also, sees all this, and reads the torn up note.Inside, Ralph and Betty and Betty's friend Laney, who is sort of silly, decide to leave immediately for Eastvale.Back at the tomb we see someone planting explosives at the base of the door, and running a blasting cap under the foundations into the tomb. Broughton arrives at the house and begins looking for the jewel. Broughton answers the door and lets in Betty, Ralph, Laney, and the parson who has also wandered by. Aga Ben Dragore and Mahmoud also arrive. Mahmoud hides on the grounds with a knife and the Aga enters the house. The Aga wants to enter the tomb but is refused. Laney is quite taken with the Aga. Betty and Ralph, when alone, reconcile. Laing returns.Professor Morlant rises from the dead, sees the jewel has been stolen and staggers out, like a zombie, and begins his search for the jewel. He encounters Mahmoud and kills him.The Aga and Laney go to the kitchen to make coffee. They are interrupted by Laing who retrieves the jewel and hides it in Miss Betty's over-night case. The Aga goes outside and Laney gets scared and joins him. The professor encounters Laing and learns that Betty has the jewel. He strangles Laing into unconsciousness.Betty goes upstairs to her room with her case. The professor follows her and takes the jewel after a struggle. Looking inside a window, the Aga sees that the professor now has the jewel. Broughton and Ralph are arguing downstairs when Betty comes in and says what has happened and faints.The professor returns to the tomb with the jewel and Laing trails behind with the cousins. The Aga rids himself of Laney. In the tomb, the professor uses a knife to draw the sign of Anubis on his chest. He then places the jewel into the hand of the statue of Anubis and waits for something to happen. The cousins enter the tomb, without Laing who has refused to go with them. Anubis closes his hand to accept the jewel and the professor collapses, dead. But then the \"parson\" comes out from behind the statue with the jewel. He had placed his own hand inside the arm of Anubis. The \"parson\" Nigel Hartley points a pistol at Ralph but Ralph throws an object at him and knocks him unconscious. However the Aga now enters, also with a pistol and wants the jewel. He and Ralph fight and Ralph hurts the Aga's arm, but eventually the Aga shoots Ralph with a glancing blow to the head which knocks him unconscious. The Aga leaves, locking everyone inside the tomb, which now catches fire from one of the torches.Earlier, Ralph had called the professor's doctor and asked him to send the police. As they are driving toward the estate the doctor tells the police that he thinks Professor Morlant wasn't actually dead, that he had just suffered from an attack of catalepsy.The Aga runs into Laney and they argue and he slaps her. As he does so, the jewel falls out of his pocket, unknown to him, and Laney picks it up.The Aga runs out to a car but Broughton is in it and pulls a pistol on him and demands the Eternal Light. The Aga surrenders but then discovers he doesn't have it and they both see Laney has it. They chase her. She holds the jewel over a well and says that if they shoot her she'll drop the jewel in the well. They are stopped at first but then decide it might be okay if the jewel goes into the well as they can retrieve it. Just as they start to shoot her, the police arrive and disarm Broughton and Laney hands them the jewel.Back inside the tomb, just when everyone seems about to die, The fake parson, Nigel Hartley, comes to and detonates the explosives, which he had buried earlier which blows the door open.Ralph and Betty come staggering out of the tomb and kiss each other.The end."

        "sinopsis": "The 1933 version of the work of H.G. Wells opens with title and credits. A man trudges through the snow to the small village of Iping. His destination is the Lion's Head Pub and Inn. The place is a buzz of activity: drinking and laughing, and a game of darts. The stranger, Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) walks in covered from head to toe, head bandaged, and wearing a false nose. All sound in the Pub ceases. The stranger approaches the proprietor, Herbert Hall (Forrester Harvey) and requests, \"I want a room and a fire.\" Hall calls to his wife, Jenny (Una OConnor). Jenny explains they have no rooms ready, as summer is their normal season, but one can be prepared. Jenny calls to Minnie (Merle Tottenham). Jenny leads Dr. Griffin to his room, sending Minnie on ahead. Minnie lights a lamp while Jenny builds a fire and explains, \"It's the coldest winter we've had down here for years.\" Griffin asks about his luggage, but Jenny explains she'll arrange for it in the morning. His final request before Jenny departs is for some food. Griffin closes the drapes in his room.The townsfolk are suspicious of the stranger. One man speculates, \"If you ask me, he's a criminal flying from justice.\" He advises Herbert to lockup his money. Jenny carries a tray up to his room and walks in without knocking. Griffin asks about a key and is told there is none. He emphatically states, \"I want to be left alone and undisturbed.\" Jenny leaves and Griffin removes his coat. Jenny returns to the kitchen only to be told by Minnie that she forgot the mustard. Jenny makes a second trip to Griffin's room. Again she does not knock, just bursts in. Griffin is seated, and the lower half of his face is gone. Jenny is shocked by what she sees as Griffin masks his face with a napkin. Griffin angrily reminds the landlady, \"I told you not to disturb me.\" Jenny cautiously approaches, mustard in hand, and asks Griffin if he's had a motor car accident. Griffin tells Jenny to take the overcoat to dry, but leave the hat. Jenny leaves Griffin's room. She runs downstairs to report to all who'll listen, \"Bandages right up to the top of his head, all around his ears.\"At a large country home, Dr. Cranley (Henry Travers) works in a large room converted into a laboratory. His daughter, Flora Cranley (Gloria Stuart) enters the lab wishing to speak. Dr. Cranley admonishes her, \"I wish you'd leave me alone, Flora, when I'm working.\" Flora is concerned nothing is being done about Jack. He has been away for a month now and no word from him. Dr. Arthur Kemp (William Harrigan) enters the room and is told Flora is worried about Dr. Jack Griffin. Flora storms off sobbing, and Arthur tries to comfort her. Dr. Kemp tells Flora, \"He meddled in things men should leave alone.\" The group was working on food preservation advances, but Jack preferred to work in secret. Flora is interested in Jack romantically, as is Dr. Kemp.A week later, Griffin is in his room. He has set the place up as a mini-laboratory and mutters to himself, \"There's a way back, you fool. There must be a way back.\" Jenny arrives with Griffin's lunch, but he still doesn't want to be disturbed. He slams the door closed and she drops the tray. Jenny tells her husband she wants him out, his room is a mess and he is behind on his rent. She sends her husband to do the dirty work. The disturbance annoys Griffin, \"And a whole days work ruined...by a foolish, ignorant woman!\" Hall barges his way into Griffin's room with bill in hand. Griffin explains his money will be forthcoming. He explains he is working and pleads for a little more time, undisturbed. Griffin admits he had an accident that disfigured him and it affected his eyes. Hall won't budge, so Griffin turns hostile. He tosses Hall out of his room and down the stairs. Bruised and bleeding, Hall comes to in the arms of his hysterical, shrieking wife. The police are summoned.Constable Jaffers (E.E. Clive) is surrounded by the townsfolk. He asks what's all this and is told the stranger with the goggles has gone mad, assaulted Mrs. Hall and nearly killed Mr. Hall. Jaffers pulls out his baton and walks upstairs, followed closely by half a dozen men. Jaffers confronts Griffin. He intends to arrest Griffin, but Griffin threatens, \"All right you fools. You've brought it on yourselves...now you'll suffer for it! You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you? All right, I'll show you.\" Griffin proceeds to remove his false nose, and then his goggles. The head under the bandages is hollow. Next he removes the bandages, laughing maniacally. Jaffers observes, \"Look. He's all eaten away.\" They all run from Griffin's room. Jaffers and a few men return to his room, but all that is visible is a shirt bobbing in the air. Griffin explains that all that was needed is a few chemicals mixed together, \"Flesh and blood and bone just fade away.\" Jaffers closes the door, but Griffin takes the window to exit the room. Jaffers runs to the window, but to his surprise, Griffin taunts him, \"Think I'd escape like a common criminal? You need a lesson. I think Ill throttle you.\" Griffin beats up the men guarding the door, then escapes downstairs knocking the grandfather clock over in the process. He steals a bicycle and rides off, and then menaces the townsfolk with pranks.Doctors Cranley and Kemp go through the fireplace ash looking for clues to Griffin's work or location. They did find a list of drugs and chemicals. The last on the list is monocaine. Cranley explains that monocaine is a terrible drug: made from a flower grown in India. It draws color from everything it touches. It was tried as a bleach for cloth, but destroyed the material. In a German experiment it was used on a dog: it bleached it white and drove it mad.Griffin enters the home of Dr. Kemp. He opens the French door and a gust of wind is blamed for a paper flying off his desk. A radio broadcast reports a mass delusion among the people of Iping; they believe an invisible man is living among them. Kemp makes the connection just as Griffin shuts off the radio and announces his presence, \"And everyone deserves the fate that's coming to them: panic, death, things worse than death. Don't be afraid Kemp. It's me, Griffin.\" A rocking chair moves across the room and the seat collapses downward. Kemp is shocked. Griffin threatens Kemp. He tells him to sit down and listen to his story. After insulting Kemp, Griffin demands a surgical bandage, a pair of dark glasses, a dressing gown, pajamas, and a pair of gloves. Griffin go to a bedroom to put his pajamas on. He continuously threatens Dr. Kemp.Chief Detective (Dudley Digges) arrives at the Lion's Head. He is annoyed and doesn't believe the stories after a ten mile search of the area. He thinks it is a hoax being used to generate publicity and business for the Pub. The inspector starts an inquiry. Back at Kemp's home, Griffin exits the bedroom covered from head to toe. Griffin and Kemp sit and talk in the study. He tells Kemp it started five years earlier, working in secret: a thousand experiments and a thousand failures. He admits he was working on an antidote. Then Griffin admitted, \"It came to me suddenly. The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain. Suddenly I realized the power I held. The power to rule, to make the world grovel at my feet. Well soon put the world right now, Kemp. You and I.\" Griffin needs a visible partner. He adds, \"We'll begin with a reign of terror, a few murders here and there...We might even wreck a train or two.\" Kemp admonishes his colleague, but is cowed by the threats. Kemp gets his car, as instructed, and they drive back to Iping to get Griffin's notes.The detective questions the townsfolk, including the bicycle owner (an uncredited Walter Brennan). Kemp and Griffin stop a short distance from the Pub. They walk to the Pub. Griffin enters the Pub and walks upstairs to his room. He gathers his books and notes and passes them through the window. As the detective goes to sign some papers the ink well moves around on the table by itself. The ink is thrown on the man's face. Mugs and pitchers fly off the walls and counters at the assembled police and witnesses. They all run from the Pub. Griffin chokes the Chief Detective and hits him with a stool. Griffin runs back to the waiting car. Dr. Cranley goes to see Inspector Lane. A crowd gathers around a newspaper boy distributing the latest news on the Invisible Man. The newspaper headline blares, \"Invisible Man Slays Policeman.\"Griffin reveals to Kemp he must remain in hiding after meals. The food is visible inside me until it is digested. I can only work on fine, clear days. If I work in the rain, the water can be seen on my head and shoulders. In a fog, you can see me, like a bubble. In smoky cities, the soot settles on me until you can see a dark outline. Griffin goes to bed after taking off his head bandages and dark glasses.The Chief of Police (Holmes Herbert) gives orders to his men on the plan to search the countryside for twenty miles in all directions. A contingent of a thousand men, and thousands more volunteers will comb the countryside. At 10:30 p.m. a radio broadcast explains that the story is not a hoax and volunteers are needed. A reward of 1000 pounds is offered. Kemp checks on Griffin to make sure he is asleep. He calls Dr. Cranley to tell him Griffin is mad and is the Invisible Man. Cranley tells his colleague he will come in the morning, but for the time being, keep Griffin calm and quiet. Flora demands to know the truth and her father tells her. A man (an uncredited John Carradine) suggest throwing ink on the Invisible Man to make him visible. Dr. Kemp calls the police and reports that the Invisible Man is asleep in his home. Flora wants to help, but her father explains it is dangerous, as Griffin is mad and dangerous. Dr. Cranley and Flora drive over to Kemp's house. Kemp admits he told Cranley when Griffin accuses him of betrayal. Despite warning, Flora goes to see Griffin in his room. Griffin tells Flora he did it all for her, to gain wealth and fame and honor. He intends to sell the secret of invisibility to the highest bidder to allow invisible armies to sweep the world. Griffin rants and raves. Flora explains that monocaine has a terrible side effect. The police surround the Kemp home. Griffin escorts Flora out of his room so he can deal with the police. The police link arms and move towards the house. Griffin confronts Kemp in his office. He promises his friend to kill him the next day at 10:00 p.m. Griffin taunts the police and escapes.The Chief of Police questions Cranley and Kemp, but gets little information. Griffin attacks a search party. He derails a train, sending it crashing into a river killing one hundred people. At Lloyd's Bank he steals a cashiers drawer and hands out cash to eager people on the street. A reporter (an uncredited Dwight Frye) asks the Chief, \"Can you tell us what plans you've got for capturing him?\" At the Cranley home, Flora paces her room. After sweeping an empty room with a net, the Chief divulges his plan. It involves the death threat on Dr. Kemp. Kemp objects to being used as bait. The plan also includes dressing Kemp up like policeman. Kemp decides to see to his own safety. He drives his own car away, but Griffin is in the back seat. Griffin gloats, telling Kemp the story of watching the elaborate plan for his safety. Griffin ties up Kemp, places him back in the car and pushes the vehicle over a cliff. The car explodes into flames.Griffin sleeps in a barn overnight. The farmer sees the hay move and walks over to investigate. It begins to snow. The farmer walks into the police station to report the Invisible Man is in his barn. The plan now is to burn down the barn and follow the footprints in the snow should he escape. The Chief fires on the Invisible Man, using his footprints in the snow to take aim at his target.At hospital, a doctor reports to the Chief that, \"He's very near the end.\" The doctor explains to Dr. Cranley that the bullet passed through both lungs. The wounds are impossible to treat. As he dies his body will become visible. Flora goes into his room to be with Griffin. We close with a close-up view of a hospital bed and pillow. At first a skull appears resting on the pillow, then his eyes, and finally the face of Dr. Jack Griffin."

        "sinopsis": "In 1933, in New York harbor Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a fierce independent film director famous for shooting animal pictures in remote and exotic locations, who is also a shifty showman, has recruited a bunch of macho seamen but is unable to hire an actress for his newest project His usual agent Charles Weston (Sam Hardy) refuses to supply anyone because of the dangerous nature of the expedition, so Carl goes wandering in the streets of New York searching for a suitable girl.He chances upon starving unemployed Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as she is caught trying to steal an apple. Denham is taken with her, pays off the grocer , then buys her a meal and tries to convince her to join him on the adventure of a lifetime, offering her the lead in his project. Although Ann is apprehensive, she has nothing to lose and agrees.They set sail aboard the Venture, a tramp steamer, and travel for weeks in the direction of Indonesia, where Denham claims they will be shooting.Despite his ongoing declarations that women have no place on board ships, the ship's first mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) is obviously becoming attracted to Ann. Denham informs Driscoll he has enough trouble without the complications of a seagoing love affair. Driscoll sneers at the suggestion, reminding Denham of his toughness in past adventures.Denham's reply outlines the theme of the movie he is making: \"The Beast was a tough guy too. He could lick the world, but when he saw Beauty, she got him. He went soft. He forgot his wisdom and the little fellas licked him.\"One afternoon Carl wants to practice filming with Ann. As he rolls the camera, he tells her first to look around relaxed, then to look puzzled, surprised, look upwards, then further upwards, terrorized and speechless, finally to scream loudly for her life, while staring at the most horrifying thing she has ever seen . . .After maintaining secrecy for weeks, Denham finally tells Driscoll and Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher) that they're searching for an uncharted island shown on a map in Denham's possession. The island has three labeled features: \"peninsula\", \"jungle\", and \"Skull Mountain\". Denham has the only map that shows the location, originally drawn by a native of the island who had been swept out to sea.Denham then describes something monstrous connected to the island, a legendary entity known to the islanders only as \"Kong\". The Captain has heard of something with that name.As the Venture creeps through the fog surrounding the island, the crew hears drums in the distance.Arriving at the island's shore, they see a native village on a peninsula, cut off from the bulk of the island by an enormous wall.A landing party, including the filming crew and Ann, goes ashore and encounters the natives, who are about to hand over a girl to Kong as a ritual sacrifice.Although Denham, Englehorn, Jack and Ann are hiding behind foliage, the native chief (Noble Johnson) spots them and approaches. Captain Englehorn is able to understand the native speech, and at Denham's urging makes friendly overtures to the chief. However, another tribe member (Steve Clemento) rushes up to the chief and tells him that the presence of outsiders has spoiled the ceremony. While translating this to the rest of the party, Englehorn says he must be the witch doctor.The chief then gets a clear look at Ann, and he begins speaking with great energy. Englehorn translates this as, \"Look at the golden woman!\" The chief proposes to swap six native women for Ann, an offer Denham delicately declines as he and his party edge away from the scene, assuring the chief that they will return tomorrow to get better acquainted.Back on the Venture, Jack and Ann openly express their love for each other. When Jack is called away to the captain's quarters, a stealthy contingent of natives captures Ann, takes her back to the wall, where she is presented to Kong in an elaborate ceremony, leaving her tied to columns behind the wall.Kong emerges from the jungle and is revealed to be a giant gorilla.The Venture crew returns to the village and open the huge gate on the wall; half of the crew then go after Kong, encountering an enraged stegosaurus, a brontosaurus, and a territorial apatosaurus. They get on a makeshift raft to cross a body of water, which is upended by a giant plesiosaurus.Up ahead in a jungle clearing, Kong places Ann in a high cleft of a tree, then goes back and confronts his pursuers as they are crossing a ravine on an enormous log. Kong shakes them off into the ravine, with only Driscoll and Denham surviving.Driscoll, continues the chase while Denham returns to get help.. Kong has become smitten with Ann, and Driscoll faces a challenge to save her from the beast and avoid being killed himself.Meanwhile, a tyrannosaurs rex approaches a terrified Ann, whose screams alert Kong, who rushes back and confronts the tyrannosaurus. The titanic fight between the two ends when Kong pries open the dinosaur's jaw until it breaks.Kong takes Ann up to his mountain lair, where a plesiosaurus emerges from a bubbling swamp and tries to strangle Kong, who kills it as well.Kong then inspects his blonde prize and begins to caress her, tearing off pieces of her clothing and tickling her.Jack interrupts the proceedings by knocking over a boulder. When the gorilla leaves Ann to investigate the noise, a pteranodon swoops from the sky and clutches Ann in its talons. A final fight ensues and the pterodactyl is dispatched.While Kong is distracted, Jack rescues Ann and takes her back to the village. To escape, at one point, they must jump into a deep pool of water many feet below.Kong chases them, breaks through the large door in the wall and rampages through the village, killing many natives.Denham hurls gas bombs at Kong, knocking him out, whereupon he exults in the opportunity presented: \"He's always been King of his world. But we'll teach him fear! We're millionaires, boys! I'll share it with all of you! Why, in a few months, his name will be up in lights on Broadway! Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World!\"The next scene shows those last words in lights on a theater marquee. Along with hundreds of curious New Yorkers, Denham, Driscoll and Ann are in evening wear for the gala event. The curtain lifts, and Denham presents a subdued and shackled Kong to the stunned audience.All goes well until photographers, using the blinding flashbulbs of the era, begin snapping shots of Ann and Jack, who is now her fiancé. Under the impression that the flashbulbs are attacking Ann, Kong breaks free of his bonds and escapes from the theater, as the screaming audience flees.He rampages through city streets, destroying an elevated train and killing several citizens. He looks into windows, his glaring eyes looming in the windows of the wrecked elevated trainKong sees Ann in an upper floor hotel room, he reaches in the window, grabs her, and carries her to the top of the Empire State Building. The military dispatches four Curtiss Helldiver biplanes to destroy Kong.The ape gently sets Ann down on the building's observation deck and climbs atop the upper mast, trying to fend off the attackers.He manages to swat one plane down, but he is mortally wounded by machine-gun fire and plummets to his death in the street below.Denham picks his way to the front of the crowd, where a cop remarks \"Well Denham, the airplanes got him.\"Denham replies, \"It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.\""

        "sinopsis": "Apple Annie (May Robson) is an aging and wretched fruit seller in New York City whose daughter Louise (Jean Parker) has been raised in a Spanish convent since she was an infant. Annie has always written to her daughter that she is a member of New York's high society, named Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, residing at the Hotel Marberry.Annie discovers her charade is in danger of being uncovered when she receives a letter from her daughter announcing that Louise is sailing to New York, with her fiancé Carlos (Barry Norton) and his father, Count Romero (Walter Connolly), a member of the Spanish aristocracy. The Count wants to meet Louise's family before giving his blessing to the marriage.Annie nearly doesn't get the letter, as she depends on intercepting any mail she gets at the Hotel Marberry. The management of the hotel does not like her coming in there, and since there's no one named Mrs. E. Worthington Manville registered there, the mail clerk was preparing to return the letter to sender. Annie was able to get to the letter before it was taken by the postman. When she read the letter outside of the hotel, she fainted.Among Annie's patrons are Dave the Dude, a gambling gangster who believes her apples bring him good luck, and his Dave's henchman, Happy McGuire (Ned Sparks). Dave is a well-known figure in underground circles, so when he learns that she's recently been escorted from the Hotel Marberry by the police and sent home, he sends for her. He's about to enter into a high stakes project of some sort and he wants to be sure Annie and her apples are available for luck. Dave the Dude reads the letter from Louise and sort of shrugs it off. Annie's friends ultimately persuade him to try and help. He has an associate who owns a vacant luxury apartment at the Hotel Marbury that is used to entertain visitors, and convinces him to loan the use of the apartment for several days.Dude's girlfriend, Missouri Martin (Glenda Farrell), is a well-to-do nightclub owner who Dude asks for assistance. Missouri brings in a group of her personal assistants to do a makeover of Annie, transforming her from a dowdy street peddler to an elegant dowager. Dave also arranges for pool hustler, Henry Blake (Guy Kibbee), to pose as Annie's husband, the dignified Judge E. Worthington Manville.The day that Louise, Carlos and Count Romero are due to arrive on a passenger ship, one of Dude's men warns him that the local newspapers are likely to be very much interested in talking to Count Romero, which means they will naturally be curious about why the Count is there and who he's meeting with. Dude decides he'd better go down to the docks himself to make sure nothing goes wrong. He positions a bunch of his men in an line to keep the news reporters away from the Count and others.Annie and Louise have a tearful and happy reunion at the pier. Dude's men are ordered to create a diversion by starting a fight when a couple of policemen are spotted approaching. The policemen are distracted by the fight while Annie, Dude, and the others take off in their cars.When a society reporter shows up at the Hotel Marbury, Dude and Happy escort him away before he can interview Annie or the Count. The reporter's newspaper subsequently reports him as missing. Two more society reporters suffer the same fate, after they become curious about Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, of whom they can find no public records. The newspaper editors accuse the police department of incompetence when there are no leads.A few days later, Blake, Judge Manville, announces he is planning a gala reception for Louise, Carlos, and Count Romero before they return to Spain. Dave is not at all pleased about that. He finds himself trying to train Annie's indigent friends to represent her society friends. Meanwhile, pressure is being applied to Dave and his men by the police, who suspect that Dave may have something to do with the missing reporters. The Chief of Police was upset that his men had no leads, the Police Commissioner was upset at the Chief, the Mayor was upset at the Commissioner, and the Governor (Hobart Bosworth) was upset at the Mayor. There were threats at every level to fire their subordinate if the reporters weren't found soon.While waiting for the guests to arrive and the reception to begin, the Count engages Blake in a discussion about Louise's dowry. That catches Blake by surprise, but he's quick on his feet and decides to take a chance by offering not only to match the Count's contribution of $50,000 to the newlyweds, but to pay the Count's share as well. The Count won't have it and instead offers to pay the entire $100,000 himself. Ultimately, the two decide to play a game of pool, with the loser agreeing to pay it all. Blake wins easily.The police surround Missouri's club, where the gang has assembled for a final rehearsal. Consequently, they are unable to make their way over to the hotel, so Dave calls Blake to advise him of their predicament, and Annie decides it's time to confess everything to Louise and Count Romero.Meanwhile, Dave and Happy are ordered to be taken by the Chief of Police to the Mayor's office, where the governor is attending a function. They want a resolution to the missing reporters. The Dude has a suggestion.The governor, mayor, and their entourages unexpectedly arrive at the reception, interrupting Annie's confession to Louise and the Count, and they all approach Annie and introduce themselves to her, Louise, and the Count, tremendously impressing everyone. The reporters are rescued and ordered to say they were out on a drunk.Annie nearly faints again, she's so shocked and relieved, happy that her daughter will soon marry into the Spanish aristocracy."

        "sinopsis": "A starry-eyed young wannabe actress comes to New York (from Franklin, Vermont) to pursue a career in acting. There she goes to the office of a famous Broadway producer, Louis Easton (Adolphe Menjou). While waiting, she meets other actors and actresses including Robert Harley Hedges (who tells her to call him \"Bob\"), an elderly British actor at the end of his career. She befriends Hedges and convinces him to become her vocal coach and mentor.Hedges is well-known to Easton and to Joseph Sheridan (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) who are in Easton's office at the time, discussing Sheridan's new play. When they come out to offer Hedges a part in the play, Eva wrangles an introduction and milks it for all it is worth. All are impressed by Eva but she leaves the impression of being more of a confused romantic who is in love with the idea of being an actress than someone who has the talent to be one. Easton dismisses her as just another young hopeful while Hedges likes her enthusiasm but Sheridan seems struck by her effervescent personality.Despite help from Hedges and Sheridan and a try-out for a small part, Eva is unsuccessful and is found one night by Hedges, starving and penniless, in a diner near Times Square. He offers her a lift home in his cab but, on the way, decides to invite her to a party he is attending at Easton's apartment.At the party, Eva's freshness, captivates all the males, especially theatre critic, Henry Lawrence (Richard Carle) and alcoholic playwright, Charley Van Duesen (Tyler Brooke). Together the three sit down and chat over a bottle of champagne but (on an empty stomach) Eva becomes intoxicated and ends up telling everyone in the room what a wonderful actress she is. Then, to prove her point, she acts out scenes from 'Hamlet' and 'Romeo and Juliet'.Her Juliet almost brings tears to Sheridan's eyes and the others in the room are impressed but Eva is so drunk that she falls asleep on Easton's knee. He has his butler take her up to a room to sleep it off.In the morning Eston calls Sheridan over (early) to help him get rid of a girl he has just spent the night with and Sheridan agrees to give her an envelope, with some money inside it, to pay her off -- with a story that Easton had to leave town on business.Sheridan uses the opportunity to promote Eva to Easton by reminding him how well she performed the previous night. Easton agrees but then says how awful he feels that he slept with her. Shocked, Sheridan heads off to give Eva the envelope and to tell her the news that Easton wants nothing more to do with her but before he gets very far, Eva swans into the room as if all her dreams have just come true. She departs, with a theatrical flourish, before Sheridan has time to inform her what Easton has just said, with the impression that she is going to to hear from Easton soon.Sometime later, a new play is opening and the leading actress, Rita Vernon (Mary Duncan) decides to use the opportunity to press for more money. She asks for her name in lights, $1500 a week, and a half share of the profits. This infuriates Easton but she insists that she will walk out if he does not agree to her terms.Outside, Sheridan urges Easton to call Vernon's bluff. He says he has a marvelous young understudy to play the role -- Eva. Eva goes on to stun the audience with her performance and becomes the toast of the town. After the show Easton comes in to congratulate her and she tries to elicit from him some sign of affection but he says there can never be anything between them. Eva is devastated.Soon after Easton leaves, Eva's dressing lady, Nellie Navarre (Helen Ware), enters and Eva confides that she feels as if she has just lost everything on the very night that she got the very thing she wanted. When Hedges and Sheridan arrive Nellie leaves and Hedges delivers a warning along with his heartfelt congratulations. He says that many young stars are 'morning glories' -- that find themselves in the limelight only for a brief period and then disappear -- pointing to Eva's dressing woman, Nellie, as a case in point. But he emphasizes that, if she works hard, Eva can have a long and illustrious career. After Hedges leaves, Sheridan stays on to declare his love for Eva but she is so depressed by Easton's rejection that she hardly seems to care and walks off.When Nellie returns, Eva tells her about Sheridan's declaration of love and Nellie reminisces that she wishes she had taken more notice of a similar declaration many years ago. But, oblivious to any advice, Eva seems to drift off into her own world, gushing over how wonderful everything will be and how she must take life as it comes and that she is unafraid of becoming a \"morning glory\". Nellie's face registers fear and concern, perhaps seeing something of herself in the heedless young woman. The audience is left to wonder just what 'will' become of Eva Lovelace."

The story begins in 1536 when the beautiful and ambitious Queen Anne Boleyn (Merle Oberon) is preparing for her execution on false charges of adultery so that her husband King Henry (Charles Laughton) can marry his empty-headed mistress (Wendy Barrie.) After the end of that marriage, Henry embarks on an arranged match with a German princess (Elsa Lanchester) who struggles to escape their marriage, pushing him into the arms of the seductive Lady Catherine Howard (Binnie Barnes), who promises to make Henry happy. However, her dangerous love for a handsome courtier (Robert Donat) ends in tragedy and Henry spends the rest of his life in marriage to a middle-aged widow who promises to take care of him, Lady Catherine Parr (Everley Gregg.)"

        "sinopsis": "Several months after he disastrously brought Kong to Manhattan, former adventure filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) hides out from his debtors in a boarding house. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against him, and he learns that he has been indicted by a grand jury for the destruction caused by Kong. When Capt. Englehorn (Frank Reicher) suggests that they immediately set sail for the South Pacific to become merchants, Denham jumps at the opportunity. The ship's chef Charlie (Victor Wong) also joins them.When they reach the port of Dakang, they are low on money to pay the increasingly angry crew. Denham and Englehorn go into a nearby village and watch a variety show involving trained monkeys and the dulcet singing voice of Hilda (Helen Mack), billed as \"La Belle Helene\". Hilda's father used to be an important vaudeville performer but is now relegated to an impoverished routine in Dakang. His only joy is drinking with an equally down-on-his-luck Norwegian skipper named Helstrom (John Marston). Hilda's father drunkenly insults Helstrom, who angrily kills him with a blow to the head. When a toppled lamp causes an uncontrollable fire, Helstrom runs off, leaving Hilda to retrieve her father's body and free the trapped show animals.The next day, Denham casually comforts the oddly unemotional Hilda. Later, he meets Helstrom and reveals to Englehorn that Helstrom had been the one to sell him the map to Skull Island. Helstrom tells them that somewhere on Skull Island is a vast treasure. Denham and Englehorn agree to return to Skull Island to find the treasure, as it would solve all of their financial problems. On the voyage, Helstrom persuades the crew to mutiny once they reach the island. But Red (Edward Brady) betrays Helstrom as well and forces him to abandon ship with Denham, Englehorn, Charlie and Hilda. As the crew sails away, Denham and the others make their way to the island. When they first land, the remaining natives recognize them and scare them away with spears. Finally, they find a secluded cove at which to dock the boat.They split up to find food. Denham and Hilda find \"Little Kong,\" a 12-foot-tall white gorilla who Denham assumes is Kong's son, trapped in quicksand. Feeling sorry for the creature, Hilda persuades Denham to push over a dead tree so Little Kong can free itself. A few minutes later, when a giant bear attacks Denham and Hilda, Little Kong races to the rescue and beats the bear away with a tree. Hilda thinks Little Kong helped them because they had helped him but Denham disagrees. All doubt is removed when Little Kong opens a temple door for them. Inside Denham finds a bejeweled necklace worth millions. When a monstrous lizard ambushes them, Little Kong beats it to death.Englehorn, Helstrom and Charlie arrive at the temple. Helstrom is surprised to find treasure there, as he had made the story up in an attempt to leave Dakang and steal Englehorn's ship. Little Kong frightens Helstrom, who runs back to the boat, intending to leave the others. But before he can, he is killed by an elasmosaurus. Hilda, Englehorn and Charlie go back to the boat while Denham and Little Kong look for more treasure.Suddenly, an earthquake and hurricane assault the island, destroying it. Hilda, Englehorn and Charlie, in the boat, try to locate Denham. Little Kong helps him to high ground. When Little Kong's foot becomes trapped in a crevice as the waters rise up to swallow even Skull Island's highest point, he holds Denham above his head until his friends can pull him into the boat. Then the island completely sinks, drowning Little Kong, all of the other fantastic creatures and the remaining natives.A passing navy ship rescues the four survivors. Later, Denham asks Hilda if Little Kong knew he was sacrificing his life to save Denham. Hilda says she thinks that animals know. She suggests that Charlie and Englehorn each get one third of the proceeds from selling the bejeweled necklace. She hopes she and Denham can share the remaining third, as she has fallen in love with him."

Burgermeister Gustave Schoen [Lionel Belmore] thinks that vampires are at large, but Detective Karl Brettschneider [Melvyn Douglas] thinks otherwise. When several people report being attacked by a giant bat, suspicion falls on Herman Gleib [Dwight Frye], the village idiot, who is known for befriending bats. When another person dies, Dr Otto von Niemann [Lionel Atwill] is called in to examine her body. He concurs with the vampirism theory. When yet another person is found dead, the word goes out that Herman must be captured.In the meantime, von Niemann's maid Georgiana [Stella Adams] finds the crucifix of one of the victims in the bedroom of von Niemann's assistant, Emil Borst [Robert Frazer], and remembers that there were muddy footprints in Emil's bedroom the morning after a victim was murdered. At the same time, however, Herman is tracked to a cave but, when the townspeople attempt to take him, he panics and falls off a ledge. He is killed, and the townspeople finish the job by driving a stake through his heart.Not knowing about Herman's death, von Niemann has hypnotized Emil to attack Georgiana in the same manner as the other victims. Emil brings her body to von Niemann's lab where she is hooked up to a machine which sucks the blood from two wounds made in her neck by a metal wraparound collar. A bit later, Karl and his girlfriend Ruth Bertin [Fay Wray] (who is also von Niemann's lab assistant) find Georgiana dead in her bedroom. Karl remembers that Herman was seen in the garden earlier that day, and the circumstantial case against him seems to tighten.However, when the Burgermeister reports Herman's death, Karl realizes that the timing is wrong and that Herman was innocent. He swears to search for clues, but Dr von Niemann advises him to first get a good night's sleep and gives him some sleeping pills to help. Later that night, Emil climbs over the roof to Karl's bedroom. Meanwhile, Ruth overhears von Niemann sending a mental suggestion to Emil, and she suspects the truth. Von Niemann confirms her suspicion, explaining that he has created a life form (looks like a sponge in a jar) that demands blood for its continued growth. Von Niemann takes Ruth to the laboratory where they find Karl waiting for him. \"I didn't take your sleeping pills, Doctor,\" explains Karl. When von Niemann attempts to place the blame on Emil, Emil shoots him and then turns the gun on himself. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]."

The couple who have been taking care of her son, Fumio, are her landlords, but they are fond of her and don't mind, even though she had been away for almost two weeks. The landlady suggest that she should find a better job or a man to marry, but Omitsu is willing to work anywhere to support her son. She returns to work, where she tries to get an advance from the owners, but she is new and, even though she is a good employee, they won't help her. A captain, who clearly has ulterior motives, gives her money to help her out.When she returns home, she finds that her husband, Mizuhara, has returned, having abandoned her several years earlier. She is angry at him, but he pleads with her to allow him just to see his son. She eventually relents, and he begins to form a relationship with his son, playing with him and forming a close bond. He is disturbed by Omitsu's unseemly work, even showing up one evening to confront the captain who is hitting on his wife. He vows to find work, so she can quit her job. He tries, but because he is a weakling, he is unable to find work, even as an apprentice at a factory.He tells Omitsu that he is unable to find work and that they are better off without him. She convinces him to keep trying. Suddenly, news arrives that Fumio has been hit by a car. The doctor tell them that their son is not in danger, but his arm will require extensive care to recover. It seems that Omitsu may have no choice but to accept the captain's aid, but Mizuhara tells her he will borrow the money they need from friends. Instead, he goes out that night and commits a robbery. Fleeing, he is shot in the arm. He eludes the police and returns to Omitsu. She is shocked to find out what he has done and refuses the money. She pleads with Mizuhara to turn himself in, but he leaves.Word arrives that Mizuhara has drowned himself. Omitu runs to the docks, where she is given a suicide note stating that they are better off without him. She returns home, angry at him for being such a weakling and a coward."

        "sinopsis": "Oil gushes and members of area Indian tribes are invited to receive funds from the US government for leases on the Indian lands. Nina (Shirley Jane Rickert), a young half-Native American girl whose mother has recently died, must find her white father in order to claim her hefty inheritance of $50,000 by making Chris Morrell (John Wayne) her guardian. Of course, a defenseless heiress seems like easy pickings to some of the Wild West's most dastardly thugs, including Sam Black (Yakima Canutt), who is soon on her trail. Thankfully, Nina has a noble guardian in cowboy Chris Morrell who vows to get the girl safely to her estranged father. While packing for their trip, there is a knock on the door. Chris hides Nina in the closet when the of Sam's renegades enters demanding Nina. Chris tries to tell the outlaws that she is not there, but Nina peeks out from the closet. A fight ensues and Sam fends off the renegades and escape with Nina by breaking the light fixture with a chair.\nChris and Nina gallop away on a horse. Sam and his men are soon in pursuit. Chris stops and gives Nina directions to Bud Moore's ranch while he stays back and stalks Black and his men. Chris hides in a thicket and fires his gun to draw the renegades' attention. Sam Black finds Chris and momentarily stuns him with a pistol whip to the head. Chris awakens, gets up, and knocks out Sam. Chris climbs up on a bluff and lassos Shorty who has stayed behind to tend to Sam's gang's horses. He raises Shorty up like a counterweight as Chris repels down and then chases off the horses, save one on which Chris makes his getaway.\nChris, however, is still suffering the effects of the blow to his head. He passes out at the edge of a stream. Nina makes her way to Bud Moore's ranch only to discover it is owned by someone else. The new owner, Vic Byrd (Jack Rockwell) is gruff and commandeers Nina as kitchen help for a friendly man named Matt Downing (George Hayes) who runs that part of the ranch operation. He is familiar with Chris Morrell.\nMeanwhile, in the town of Snake River, Clara Moore is checking on an order of calico when the Snake River Express office is robbed of $6000 by a man in a checkered shirt and black hat. On his escape, the desperado comes across unconscious Chris Morrell and takes his shirt and hat leaving his own on Chris and rides away. A short time later, Clara rides by in her horse and buggy. She finds Chris unconscious and revives him with a damp cloth. She tells the revived Chris that the only thing for her to do is turn him into the sheriff. Chris tries to convince Clara that the clothes he has on are not his. He tells Clara about his little partner, Nina, who he sent to Bud Moore's place. Clara reveals she is Bud Moore's sister, and that Bud was killed in the range wars several months earlier. When he reveals himself to be Chris Morrell, Clara declares that Bud said he was the best friend a man could have. She suggests changing his shirt at her place.\nAt Clara's home, Chris tells Clara the story of Nina's origins of her Indian mother and no-account white father when her brother Jim (Buffalo Bill Jr.) arrives. Chris recognizes him as the man who changed shirts with him but does not tell Clara because it would break her heart and because \"snakes like him usually die of their own poison\".\nNina and Matt are feeding the pigs when Nina's real father Tom (Earl Dwire) rides up. Jim, going with his partner Vic Byrd to retrieve the stolen money, find Sam Black s gang's horses that Chris had stampeded. Meanwhile, Sam Black orders a blister-footed Shorty to find his men some horses. He limps off but it isn't long until he meets Jim and Vic riding with the horses and interested in a conversation with Sam Black. Vic Byrd bargains with Sam to cut him in for $10,000 and Chris Morrell s scalp to turn over the girl at his ranch. Matt Downing rides up to find Chris Morrell and takes him back to the Byrd Ranch.\nJim and Vic head to the tree stump where the money is hidden. Once they arrive, Jim retrieves the money only to be shot so Vic could claim both shares. Matt and Chris are startled when they hear the gunshots nearby. They ride up just as Vic gallops off with all the money. Jim tells Matt and Chris that Vic is heading to the ranch to hand over Nina to Sam Black. Chris orders Matt to take Jim to a doctor and heads to the ranch to save Nina. The Black gang find Clara and ask for Chris' whereabouts. Not finding Chris at Clara's home, they force Clara to ride along with the gang. Vic returns to the ranch and finds Tom playing with his daughter. Tom refuses to turn Nina over to Vic who stands to collect $10,000 from Sam Black.\nWhen Chris Morrell rides up, Nina announces his arrival and Tom shoots Vic. Sam Black and gang ride up and take refuge in the barn with Clara in tow. The two sides exchange pistol fire. Meanwhile in town, Matt has alerted the sheriff who speeds with a posse to the Byrd Ranch. Matt and Chris shoot one renegade off the barn roof but are down to their last bullet. Sam waves a white rag and offers to 'trade the woman for the kid\" Chris responds, \"Not in a million years.\" Chris offers to trade himself for Clara. Sam agrees. As Chris and Clara pass each other in the exchange, Chris encourages Clara to keep going no matter what happens. Tom shoots their final cartridge and Chris pretends to be dead. Seeing this, Sam orders his men to rush the house.\nChris trips up the last man, and they begin to wrestle. The sheriff and his posse arrive and begin another gunfight with Sam's gang. Sam Black ducks inside the house, shoots Tom, and grabs Nina. He takes a chair, breaks out a window in the back and throws Nina out and follows himself. They mount Sam's horse and ride away as the gunfight continues. Chris gets to the house and learns that Sam has grabbed Nina and ridden off. He jumps on his horse in hot pursuit. Meanwhile the posse overwhelms Sam's men. Matt and the sheriff find the stolen money on Vic Byrd s body. Sam Black and Nina ride off a cliff and plunge into the water below. Chris stands on his horse and jumps into the water as well. Sam pulls a knife, a fierce fight ensues, but Chris is able to drown him in the river.\nLater, Nina and Matt open a door where Clara and Chris are cuddling inside. Happily reunited with Nina, Chris returns to Clara's loving arms."

        "sinopsis": "The movie opens with the airplane circling the Earth, A Universal Picture, logo, and the title and credits. At a busy train station, passengers come and go. A train official examines the papers of Peter Alison (David Manners) and his wife, Joan (Julie Bishop as Jacqueline Wells). Satisfied, he closes the door of their compartment and moves on. The Alisons settle into their comfortable accommodations, but are soon interrupted by the conductor, \"Excuse me sir, lady, a terrible mistake has occurred. The half sold space in your compartment to a gentleman. It is terrible.\" The gentleman in question is Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Bela Lugosi). He agrees to make himself comfortable in the passenger car, but Peter insists he join them in their compartment. Werdegast stares at Joan, then at Peter, and finally up at a precariously placed bag above the Alisons. He jumps to his feet and catches the bag before it can fall on the couple. The three introduce themselves. Werdegast explains he is going to visit an old friend. The train rolls on to the first stop where it is pouring rain. Werdegast explains to Peter he was incarcerated at a prison in Omsk on Lake Baikal in Siberia. \"Many men have gone there. Few have returned. I have returned. After fifteen years, I have returned!\"The bus from the Hotel Hungaria in Gombos takes the four to the hotel. Werdegast tells the driver to drop him off at the Poelzig house on the way. Werdegast's servant, Thamal (Harry Cording) sits listening to the driver explain the sights. It is still raining heavily and the driver loses control of the bus. It crashes and the driver is killed. The passengers survive, but Joan is slightly injured. Thamal carries Joan to the Poelzig house, while Werdegast and Peter carry the bags. The Majordomo (Egon Brecher) answers the doorbell and lets the weary travelers into the house. On the way to their rooms, Werdegast tells the servant to call the authorities in Visegrad and report the accident and that the driver was killed. The Majordomo informs Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff as Karloff) by intercom that Werdegast has arrived. Poelzig gets out of bed, puts on a robe and slippers while Werdegast dresses a wound on Joan and gives her a mild sedative, Hyoscine. Poelzig enters the room and Werdegast addresses him, \"It has been a long time Hjalmar. The years have been kind to you.\" Werdegast looks towards Joan and continues, \"An accident on the road below. We are all very fortunate to be alive. Mr. and Mrs. Alison are going to Gombos. Mrs. Alison is slightly injured. I took the liberty of bringing them here.\" Poelzig escorts Werdegast out of the room, leaving Peter to fret over his sleeping wife.Werdegast confronts Poelzig over his treachery during the war. He does admire the construction of the house, \"A masterpiece of construction, built upon the ruins of the masterpiece of destruction.\" Werdegast reminds Poelzig of his time in prison and then asks about his wife and daughter. Werdegast knows about his wife's travels with Poelzig and traced them to this house. He asks point blank, \"Where is she?\" Before Poelzig can answer, Peter wanders into the room. Poelzig invites Peter to join them in a drink. Peter explains that he is a mystery writer. When Werdegast sees a black cat, he drops his glass and throws a knife at the creature, killing it instantly. Joan wanders into the room in a drug induced trance. She asks Werdegast, \"You are frightened, doctor?\" Poelzig explains to Joan, \"You must be indulgent of Dr. Werdegast's weakness. He is the unfortunate victim of one of the commoner phobias, but in an extreme form. He has an intense and all-consuming horror of cats.\" Peter kisses his wife then carries Joan back to her room and puts her to bed. Poelzig escorts Peter and Dr. Werdegast to their rooms. They discuss the origins of black cat superstitions. Werdegast and Peter decide to trade rooms so Peter can be closer to his wife. He asks the doctor if his wife will be well enough to travel to Gombos in the morning and is told yes.Poelzig wanders the lab petting his cat. He examines a couple of embalmed women in display cases. He returns to Dr. Werdegast's room and is surprised to find Peter. Werdegast invites Poelzig into his room and closes the door that adjoins Peters room. Again Werdegast asks where his wife is. Poelzig replies, \"Very well, Vitas. I shall take you to her.\" The two walk downstairs to the main room. Next they walk down another set of stairs that served as the passage to the gun turrets when the property was a fort. They walk until they arrive at the old chart room. Poelzig turns on a light that illuminates a woman hanging in a display case. \"You see Vitas, I have cared for her tenderly and well. You will find her almost as beautiful as when you last saw her. She died two years after the war.\" When Werdegast asks how, he is told of pneumonia. Poelzig tells the doctor that his daughter is also dead. Werdegast does not believe Poelzig and pulls a gun on the architect. Before he can pull the trigger, a black cat appears and Werdegast falls back against a glass chart on the wall. Poelzig escorts Werdegast back upstairs and invites him to play another game when the Alisons leave.Poelzig returns to his room and goes back to bed. His wife inquires about the commotion below stairs. He tells Karen (Lucille Lund) to stay in her room the next day. We learn that Karen is Dr. Werdegast's daughter. In his room, Werdegast tells his servant, Thamal, to put away the knife. They must choose their time carefully. The house is undermined with dynamite, so they must be very careful. Poelzig reads his book on Satanism before turning the light out. The passage refers to a ceremony involving a human sacrifice of a woman. The next morning Werdegast looks in on his patient, Joan. She starts to remember the accident, but not the injury or treatment. Poelzig enters the room to check on his guest. Werdegast and Poelzig sit at a chess set and agree to play a game for the freedom of the girl, Joan. Werdegast is invited to witness the ceremony Poelzig plans for the evening, with Joan as the guest of honor in the ritual.Peter and Joan decide they don't like the house or Poelzig and they want to leave immediately. Two policemen arrive at the house. The Lieutenant (Albert Conti) and the Sergeant (Henry Armetta) question the three men about the accident on the road. Peter explains they were on their way to Gombos when the bus crashed. Part of the road gave way due to the rain and the bus tipped over. Peter explains that he needs to get to Visegrad so his wife can contact her parents in Vienna. All his attempts to depart are thwarted by Poelzig: inoperative car, dead telephone to call for a car. Werdegast and Poelzig continue their game of chess and Poelzig wins. Peter gets his wife and tells her they are leaving, even if they have to walk. Peter and Joan walk to the front door where Thamal stands guard. Peter commands Thamal, \"Open the door.\" Thamal grabs Peter by the throat and knocks him to the floor. The Majordomo catches the fainting Joan. Thamal carries Joan back upstairs and tosses her on her bed. Poelzig enters her room and locks the side door, and then exits and locks the main bedroom door. As Thamal picks Peter up, Werdegast warns, \"I hope you won't carry this too far, Hjalmar.\" The two servants take Peter down into the basement and lock him in a room with a revolving wall.Poelzig sits at an organ and plays the Tocatta in D Minor by Bach. Werdegast secrets a key into his hand and enters Joan's locked room upstairs. He assures Joan she has nothing to fear from him. He tells Joan, \"Please, Child. Listen to me. We're all in danger. Poelzig is a mad beast. I know. I know, I've seen the proof. He took Karen, my wife, murdered her and murdered my child.\" He tells her he shall have his revenge and very soon. Werdegast tells Joan that Poelzig is a Satanist, and she will play a part in the ritual this evening. The organ music stops and Werdegast knows he must get back downstairs to Poelzig. In parting, Werdegast tells Joan, \"Be brave. It is your only chance.\" Werdegast walks back downstairs and Poelzig motions for the key. A black cat runs into Joan's room. A woman in a long, black dress, with long blonde hair enters the room. Karen introduces herself as Mrs. Poelzig. Joan makes the connection and asks if she is Karen Werdegast. \"Yes, yes how did you know my name?\" When Joan explains she knows Karen's father, Karen corrects her, \"Oh, no, you are mistaken. My father died in prison. Herr Poelzig married my mother. She died when I was very young.\" Poelzig is outside Joan's door and overhears the exchange, including Joan's news that her father is alive and in the house looking for her. Poelzig enters the room and picks up the cat. His wife scurries back to her room. The door slams shut and we hear the exchange between husband and disobedient wife. Later we will learn he killed her.It is late evening and Poelzig is outside. It is cloudy and windy. The servants prepare for the guests and the ceremony. Poelzig, dressed in ceremonial black robe, descends the stairs to greet his Satan worshipping accolades. They are dressed formally and stand before a double-X-shaped cross on a dais. Poelzig takes his place behind the cross. Werdegast joins the worshippers, who now don black robes of their own. An organ is played in the background. Poelzig begins chanting in Latin. Joan is dragged from her room by two women and two men. She pleads to be let go. She faints on the altar and slumps over the cross.Down in the basement, Peter comes to and hears the organ music. He finds the light switch and operates the moving wall. Poelzig approaches Joan. A woman in a white dress turns to observe Poelzig and screams and faints. The distraction allows Werdegast and Thamal to rescue Joan from the altar. Peter finds the correct door and escapes his confinement. He sees one of the embalmed women, hanging in the display case. Werdegast leads the way down the spiral staircase, while Thamal carries Joan. As the Majordomo enters the lab, Peter waits to ambush the man. The two struggle, but the Majordomo succeeds in escaping. He pulls his gun and shoots Thamal. Thamal is strong and kills the Majordomo. As Werdegast tries to escort Joan to safety, she tells him of Karen, his daughter. She explains that Karen is Poelzig's wife. Werdegast finds Karen's body under a sheet in the lab. He screams. Joan and Poelzig enter the room. The two men struggle on the floor. With his last bit of strength, Thamal comes to the aid of Werdegast. He first locks the door. We see blood running from his mouth. Next he grabs Poelzig and the two men carry a struggling Poelzig over to a restraint device. They secure the man's wrists high above his head. Werdegast strips the shirt off Poelzig's body. Poelzig hangs helpless on the very device he so often used on his victims. With a glee in his voice, Werdegast tells Poelzig, \"Do you know what Im going to do to you now? No? Did you ever see an animal skinned, Hjalmar? Hey, hey, hey. That's what I'm going to do to you now. Flail the skin from your body, slowly, bit by bit.\" He retrieves a scalpel from the table top. Joan watches with horror as Werdegast taunts the struggling man, \"How does it feel to hang on your own embalming rack, Hjalmar?\" We see, in shadow, Werdegast skinning Hjalmar Poelzig. Peter is drawn to Joan by her screams. The door is locked and Peter implores his wife to get the key. Thamal has it in his clenched, dead hand. Werdegast helps Joan retrieve it, but Peter doesn't know Werdegast is helping Joan. He orders Werdegast to stand back, then shoots the doctor when he fails to comply. Joan opens the door for her husband. After explaining he only wanted to help, Werdegast order the Alisons to leave quickly. With his strength diminishing, Werdegast approaches the self-destruct panel. \"It's the red switch, isn't it Hjalmar? The red switch ignites the dynamite.\" He throws the power lever and tells Poelzig that in five minutes all will be destroyed. Joan and Peter exit the house and explosions are heard. They get a safe distance away from the house as it is destroyed. They stop a passing car on the road.Safely aboard the train, the conductor punches their tickets from Visegrad to Budapest and returns their passport. Peter picks up a newspaper and sees a review of his novel, Triple Murder. \"In Triple Murder, Mr. Alison's latest mystery thriller, he fulfills the promise shown by the Sixty-ninth Crime in the Purple Spot. We feel, however, that Mr. Alison has in a sense overstepped the bounds of the matter of credibility. These things could never, by the furtherest stretch of the imagination, actually happen. We could wish that Mr. Alison would confine himself to the possible, instead of letting his melodramatic imagination run away with him.\" We close with Peter and Joan looking at each other in amusement and the cast credits."

        "sinopsis": "Mrs. Sally Jordan (Virgina Hammond) asks her faithful, former houseboy, Charlie Chan (Warner Oland), now a detective with the Honolulu police force, to personally transport to El Dorado a pearl necklace that she has sold to millionaire J. P. Madden, as something seems suspicious in the transaction. Bob Crawford (Donald Woods), son of the jewelry store owner who has set up the deal, precedes Chan to Madden's house to insure that the place is safe and, on the train, meets Paula Graham, a film director's assistant traveling to El Dorado to arrange a film shoot on Madden's property. As they approach the ranch by cab, they hear gunshots.Inside the house, Martin Thorne (Murray Kinnell), Madden's secretary, bends over a body in the bedroom and, when he answers Paula and Bob's knock, tells them that Madden is away and urges Bob to stay, though Bob has revealed that the pearls will arrive the next day by messenger.Chan arrives the next day dressed as a menial, calling himself \"Ah Kim,\" and Thorne hires him as the new cook, as the regular cook is away. While snooping around, Chan notices that a revolver from Madden's collection has been removed and used recently. In Madden's bedroom, he finds bullet holes in the wall and blood stains on the carpet, which someone had attempted to conceal. Believing Madden to have been murdered by Thorne, Bob is amazed when Jerry Delaney, whom he believes to be Madden, shows up.As Bob and Chan drive into the garage one night, they find the dead body of the former cook. The cook's talking Chinese parrot, who made comments suggestive of a murder, is then discovered poisoned, which reveals to Chan that both the cook and the bird witnessed something amiss. Delaney demands that the necklace be handed over, and privately Bob asks Chan for the goods, but Chan is not yet convinced that everything is as it should be and holds on to Mrs. Jordan's property. Chan and Bob discover a suitcase in the attic that belongs to Delaney and ascertain that he arrived by train the night before Bob's arrival.The movie crew finally arrives, and when the director asks Paula to investigate an old mine where he wants to shoot a scene, a crook jumps out and attacks her. Bob goes looking for Paula, discovers her at the mine and struggles with the crook before finally overpowering him. Paula tells Bob that there is another captive in the mine, Madden. Soon after, Victor Jordan, Sally Jordan's son, arrives at the Madden ranch and blows the whole investigation by telling Delaney that Bob should have handed over the pearls days earlier and demanding that Chan, or \"Ah Kim,\" deliver the pearls as his mother instructed. Delaney uses his left hand to sign a receipt, and Chan, knowing Madden to be right-handed, grabs the pearls and pulls a gun on him.Sergeant Brackett arrives and doesn't believe that \"Ah Kim\" is really Chan; he gives the pearls back to Delaney, just as Madden enters with a bandaged shoulder. Madden reveals that Delaney, his look alike, has a history of impersonating him and accuses Thorne, rightly, of double-crossing him. The case solved and the pearls safely delivered, Paula, Bob and Chan travel back to San Francisco, and on the rear train platform, Paula and Bob embrace happily."

The boy mouse gets back up and climbs the rose and tries to fly but the wind blows him backwards and his rear end gets poked by the thorn in the tree. He falls down in the tub just as his mother finishes putting on a dress for his sister and gets them both wet. His sisters dress shrinks and his mother gets mad at her son. The boy mouse feeling embarrassed, he tries to run away but his mother grabs his tail and spanks his exposed rear end with his tail until his bottom turns red. His mother lets him go and his brothers laugh at him again for getting a spanking. The boy mouse cries and walks away, but then the butterfly calls for help and the boy mouse attacks the spider and saves the butterfly from the spiders web and the fairy transforms into a beautiful blue fairy who grants the boy mouses wish that he wants to fly like the bird. She gives the boy mouse bat wings and he tries out his bat wing and has fun flying around. But when he shows off in front of the birds, the birds just fly away from him. He then flies down to his 3 mouse brothers and mother mouse but they get scared and they run and hide in the pumpkin house and they mistake him for a bat and attack him and the boy mouse flies into a bat cave where the bats make fun of the boy mouse for having bat wings and sing and dance \"You're nothing but a nothing\". The boy mouse gets scared and flies away from the bat cave, looks at his reflection and decides he doesn't want bat wings anymore but can't pull them off. He cries until the blue fairy shows up again and asks why he's crying. The boy mouse tells the blue fairy he's not a mouse and wishes he could die. But the blue fairy decides to remove the bat wings and the boy mouse is happy and he runs home to his mother and hugs and kisses her and his 3 mouse brothers dance around him."

Delilah and Peola quickly become like family to Jessie and Bea. They particularly enjoy Delilah's pancakes, made from a special family recipe.\nWhen Bea is unable to make a living selling pancake syrup (as her husband had done), she comes up with the idea to open a pancake restaurant (using Delilah's recipe and labor) on the boardwalk, which proves to be very profitable. Later, at the suggestion of Elmer Smith (Ned Sparks), she sets up an even more successful pancake flour corporation, marketing Delilah as an Aunt Jemima-like figure.\nAs a result, Bea becomes a wealthy business woman, but all is not found to be well as the story advances fifteen years. Eighteen-year-old Jessie (Rochelle Hudson) falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, Steven Archer (Warren William), who is unaware at first of her affections. Meanwhile, Peola (Fredi Washington), ashamed of her African-American heritage, attempts to pass as white, breaking Delilah's heart.\nPeola eventually runs away from home. While she is away, Delilah falls ill and dies. Delilah wished for a large, grand funeral, which Bea provides for her, complete with a marching band and a horse-drawn hearse. Just before the processional begins, a remorseful, crying Peola appears, begging her mother to forgive her. The film ends with Bea breaking her engagement with Steven because of the situation with Jessie."

After an argument, she escapes the yacht and swims away. She buys a bus ticket to travel back to New York to her husband, where she meets an out of work reporter named Peter Warne. Eventually he finds out her true identity from a newspaper article about her escape. He offers to help her get to her destination in exchange for exclusive rights to her story, and secures her cooperation by threatening to turn her in to her father if she does not agree.\nAndrews and Warne share hotel rooms on their trip, pretending to be husband and wife to keep from arousing suspicion. Because she is a married woman, they put up a blanket as a barrier, with Warne referring to it as the walls of Jericho. One of the other bus passengers recognizes Andrews from an article offering a $10,000 reward for her return. While the bus is stranded in mud, the passenger offers to split the money with Warne if he helps him turn in Andrews. Warne scares the passenger away by implying that hes a professional criminal looking for $1,000,000 in ransom money and then threatens to shoot him when he becomes frightened. Warne and Andrews then leave the bus to hitchhike in case the other passenger decides to turn them in to the police.\nAfter they spend the night sleeping in hay, Andrews gets a driver to stop by flashing one of her legs, who turns out to be a robber who drives off with their possessions. After chasing after him, Warne inexplicably returns with a bloody temple and the mans car. In the meantime, the father reluctantly agrees to allow the marriage to the aviator if his daughter returns. While spending another night in a blanket-partitioned hotel room, Andrews throws herself at Warne and proposes that they both be together. Warne seemingly rejects her and after she falls asleep he drives back to New York in the middle of the night. He sells his story about his love and potential marriage to Andrews to his old boss for $1000, so as not to propose to her while broke. Meanwhile, the suspicious manager of the hotel kicks out Andrews when she finds out that Warne has left.\nThinking that Warne hates her, Andrews phones her father in order to turn herself in. Her father picks her up with a police escort while Warne is returning just in time to see them drive by. Angry with her, Warne contacts the father about reward money. He agrees to go to their home while a real marriage ceremony for Andrews and the aviator is to take place. He only comes to collect $39.60 for his expenses and not the full $10,000 and admits to the father that he loves his daughter. The father starts to like Warne and during the ceremony manages to convince his daughter that Warne really loves her and that she should leave the aviator. Andrews runs away during the ceremony, her father pays off the aviator to annul the wedding, and she eventually marries the reporter. The film ends in a hotel room with the \"walls of Jericho\" coming down."

        "sinopsis": "The movie opens in Dublin, Ireland in 1920 where the British have imposed an Order of Martial Law due to political unrest. The order imposed a curfew between 12 midnight and 6 AM. British troops are seen clearing the street and emptying the pubs after midnight. Peadar Conlan, a Sinn Fein member, the Commandant of the Tenth Dublin Brigade, is wanted for sedition and is hosting a meeting in the basement of a building. The meeting is about to be interrupted by British Intelligence and soldiers. One intelligence office is shot by a rooftop sniper while preparing to enter the basement stairwell. The British break in and the lights are turned off and Conlan is convinced to escape out a back door. One of the Sinn Fein fires a pistol at the British invaders. British intelligence officer Captain Andrew (Andy) Kerr returns fire and hits a different man. The Irishmen are rounded up and removed and upon investigation Kerr discovers the body of the dead man he shot is named Kirby, a friend of his.\nKerr returns home to his anxious waiting wife Norah. Andy is upset and reveals that he has killed their Irish friend Kirby who turned out to be a Sinn Fein member. Andy's mother was Irish but he is committed to doing his duty as a British officer. Norah suggests they take a break from Dublin and go to Branscombe. While Norah is playing the piano Andy states that he believes she is thinking of someone else but affirms that that he still thinks their relationship is a good bargain.\nBritish officer Captain William (Bill) Tennant, a Canadian who came over during the war, and has served in Egypt and Africa arrives in Dublin at army headquarters on a horse drawn cart. The wise-cracking officer and his attendant dismount. Before entering headquarters Bill purchases a bouquet of flowers from a young girl. The captain is greeted by other officers and he answers questions about a incidents with a woman in Cairo and another with a Russian dancer in the Balkans. General Furlong requests the captain start the next morning at 9 AM. General Furlong's aide, Lt. Merriman is impressed by Tennant's reputation. Tennant requests Merriman arrange quarters for him and he is assigned a billet in a flat on Echo Street. On the way out, Bill arranges to meet the flower selling girl to buy another bouquet the next morning at 9 AM.\nTennant and his aide Homer travel by horse cart to 49 Echo Street. Tennant is unimpressed by the flat and furnishings and is about to leave when he hears a woman singing and playing the piano upstairs. Bill informs Homer they are going to stay and he starts clapping and cheering bravo when the song ends. Andy is home with Norah and he goes out on the landing to see who is making the fuss. Andy looks down and recognizes Tennant with whom he has served. Andy hasn't seen Bill since Cairo, when Bill was in a jam over a married woman. Bill notices Andy is wearing a suit and Andy explains he is now in British Intelligence and is married. Bill asks if he knows the wife and Andy says he doubts it and that he met his wife in Devonshire in Branscombe three years ago. Bill states that he spent a month there once. Andy invites Bill up for tea. When Bill enters their flat he and Norah obviously recognize each other. When Andy leaves the room to get the tea Bill and Norah have a brief conversation. Norah prepares the first cup of tea with two lumps of sugar and passes it to Andy who states he doesn't take sugar. Bill offers to take the cup as that is the way he likes it.\nBill leaves and prepares to go out to sample Dublin nightlife and his aide gives him an overcoat to cover up his uniform. Bill goes to the Rivoli bar and music hall where there is juggling and dancers. The waitress notices Bill's uniform under his coat and asks if he is British. She then informs a table of three Irishmen that Bill is a British officer. Bill subsequently corrects the waitress and says he is Scotch. One of the men, O'Duffy approaches and joins him for a drink. O'Duffy states that whispers are for sale and gives Bill the password, Kathleen O'Houlihan, if he needs money. Bill states he'd rather meet the Irish dancer Pauline O'Connor who is on stage performing.\nThe next morning Tennant shows up an hour late and stops to buy a bouquet of flowers from the girl. Bill explains to Merriman that he didn't get a message from the general because he'd been out all night and didn't get back to his flat until 9 AM. Bill apologizes to the general for being late. Tennant is assigned is to search a district where the general believes Peadar Conlan is hiding. As the captain and troops arrive they come under fire from a sniper in a window. The truck driver and another soldier are shot before Tennant gives the order to return fire. When Tennant reports back, the general decides to send more troops that night under British Intelligence and Kerr assigned as leader. Bill offers to deliver the orders to Kerr as he is going home.\nNorah and Andy are having dinner. Norah tries to convince Andy to eat by candlelight but Andy resists and Norah turns the lights back on. Andy explains to Norah that Bill is an irresponsible daredevil in action and is also a ladies man. Bill shows up with Andy's orders. Norah is frightened and begs Andy not to go and suggests he trade off the assignment, perhaps with Bill. Andy dismisses her objections and leaves. Bill stays behind and him and Norah discuss their relationship and feelings. There is flashback to when Bill and Norah were together in Branscombe.\nKerr and his troops begin a house by house search for Conlan. Kerr goes through a window into a dwelling alone and goes down the stairs to the basement. He is shot at and after a shoot out kills a Sinn Feiner. Conlan is in an adjacent room and fires at Kerr. Kerr is out of bullets and retrieves his dead assailant's pistol. He shoots Conlan in the arm and captures him. When Kerr returns home he finds Norah is still up. Andy is excited and tells Norah that there is a 1,000 pound reward that can pay for their vacation. Tennant comes out of a room and joins the couple. Andy is confused and request Norah tell him what is going on. Norah sends Bill away. Norah reminds Andy that he has always known that there had been someone else and that someone was Bill Tennant. Kerr is upset and states that if he goes out and is killed that might solve both their problems and leaves the flat and goes to a pub. Norah goes to follow him and runs into Bill who convinces her to stay home and promises to go out and find Andy.\nAt a British military hearing, Conlan is sentenced to hang. Protestors outside have Free Conlan signs and are moved away by British soldiers. Kerr is wandering the streets and is spotted by two Sinn Feiners and followed to a pub. The bartender is enlisted by the two men to send Kerr out to the back alley where he is ambushed and taken away in a truck.\nWhen Tennant arrives at the headquarters the next morning he finds Norah waiting there for news of Andy. Bill expresses his love but Norah explains that her love for Bill was just a romantic dream and that she loves Andy. When the general arrives Norah tells him that Andy has disappeared. O'Duffy then arrives to meet with the general and Bill recommends that the general speak to him. O'Duffy tells the general that Kerr is in the hands of those who are not friends of his and offers Captain Andrew Kerr in exchange for Peader Conlan. The general states the hangman left England last night and that Conlan will be hanged the next morning at 6 AM. Norah is asked to identify the wallet O'Duffy has brought and begs the general to save Andy. The general states he can do nothing more and refuses to release Conlan. The general is certain his troops will be able to find and release Kerr and O'Duffy leaves.\nBill goes to the Rivoli bar and uses the password Kathleen O'Houlihan to meet O'Duffy. Bill proposes paying for Kerr's release but O'Duffy states they will only accept Conlan's release. Bill returns to headquarters and goes into the general's office stating he has misplaced his suspects list and wants to copy the general's list. The Sergeant Major on duty contacts Lt. Merriman about Bill going into the general's office and Merriman advises he is on his way. Bill breaks into the general's desk and forges a prisoner's release for Conlan. Bill runs into Merriman and bluffs his way out. There is a crowd of people praying outside the prison when Bill arrives.\nKerr is walked into a street by three armed men and set free after being told Conlan was released. There is a crowd outside headquarters cheering in the street celebrating Conlan's release. The general issues orders to block all exits from Dublin to attempt to recapture Conlan. Lt. Merriman advises the general that Captain Tennant had been in his office and his desk was broken into. Kerr arrives at headquarters and the general advises him that Tennant secured his release by forging Conlan's release papers and has thereby ruined his career. Outside headquarters, Andy meets Bill who tell him that Norah is really in love with Andy. After Bill heads into headquarters Norah arrives in a car and runs to embrace Andy. Tennant turns himself in to the general and admits what he's done and states that he expects to serve at least three years in jail. Bill's explanation to the general for his actions is that it is a personal matter. Norah and Andy watch from a window as Tennant is driven away in a truck. The flower girl approaches the truck and Bill buys another bouquet and tells her he won't be gone so long and will pop up again some spring morning."

        "sinopsis": "The film opens with John Wayne and John Weston, riding along, singing on his horse. He arrives in town and right about then sees some outlaws have just robbed a Wells Fargo bank, and a shootout ensues with Marshall Higgins. John joins in and manages to shoot the baddies. When reinforcements show up to help the marshal, John flees. The marshal says, \"boys, get that man, I want him!\"\nThe marshal chases after John Wayne, and soon the catch up with him. The marshal, played here by Gabby Hayes, tells him he's got a job for him. The Marshall tells him about the rodeo, and how there's a certain gang that always seems to win each year. He proposes that John go to it and compete to find out what's going on. He agrees.Marshal Higgins introduces John, as his new deputy, to Cramer, an old guy gathering firewood. I want you to paddle over western to the shortcut trail, the one that leads to Dalton. So they both climb into a canoe and head down the river. They go ashore and Cramer gives him the rest of the directions to follow.Meanwhile, a stagecoach arrives in town and Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young) and Dolores (Anita Campillo) climb inside for the ride. John rides along and watches the coach go by. From the stagecoach Dolores waives a white kerchief and outlaws pursue the stagecoach. John see's what's going down and is soon in pursuit. John is able to stop the outlaws, and the stage driver is grateful, and asks if he's heading to the Dalton rodeo. When he says yes, they offer for him to travel with them.John rides with Marjorie and Dolores, and mentions the kerchief. Dolores said it was for help, that she saw him, but he seems suspicious.\nOnce in town, Marjorie introduces John to her father, Judge Carter (Lafe McKee). The judge wants to talk more with John, once he settles in. Dolores, meanwhile, meets with some of the outlaws and makes her excuses for the failed holdup scheme. She's in on their criminal activities it would seem.They hear about John and plan to take care of him. John, meanwhile, meets with the judge, and finds out he's the justice of the peace, and as JP he's suspicious of this Rodeo gang, and wants to make John a deputy. John can't accept though, as it would interfere with his plans to enter the rodeo.The next day the rodeo begins with people marching the flags. There are people marching in on horses and waiving, native Americans arriving, etc, all to a large cheering audience. The announcer welcomes everyone and soon the events begin. Marshall Higgins meets up with John to tell him to be careful.\nThe events begin with horses racing, lasso demonstrations and the Roman standing race which just looked incredibly dangerous. The calf roping contest is next. All told, it's an interesting window into the world of the rodeo nearly 100 years ago.John shows up to do some roping and sets a world record. The outlaws see what's going on and conspire about doing something about John.\n\"He looks like a ringer to me!\". They outlaws get the order to take him out and rough him up. John is approached by Marjorie who invites him to dinner, around the time that Dolores shows up and does the same. John looks confused, but at a cue from Marshall Higgins nearby, he decides to go with Dolores to investigate the gang. Marjorie appears, as your suspect, to be heart-broken.Back at her place, Dolores introduces Cheyenne Kent (played by Yakima Canutt). Kent has a drink, and John notices the reflection of sneaky outlaws in the bottle and prepares as they ambush. There's a big skirmish in the dark and you can't see anything. Dolores relights a lamp in time to see that John got away.John meets up with the Sheriff (George Cleveland) at the bank and tells him about being jumped by the outlaws, but the Sheriff seems concerned about leaving the protection of the bank. John gets his earnings from the rodeo so far and is about to leave when Marjorie walks by. He says hello but she just gives him the cold shoulder.At the saloon, John catches up with the Marshall, and he tells him that Barton (Edward Peil Sr) is they one they need to go after. John goes to the bar and places a bet: a thousand dollars on his own name to win. Barton shows up to speak with John in private and makes an offer that he come and work for him. He agrees meets some of the outlaws, who don't look terribly fond of him, then goes back and changes his bet to $2000 on his name. The boss seems convinced John will do them good, but the outlaws remain suspicious.John gives an update to the Marshall, who gives him a warning to be mighty careful.\nThe next date at the rodeo the announce says they will be doing riding, roping and bull-dogging, with the Man from Utah (john) and Cheyanne Kent. Several scenes of cattle rustling follow. Since it appears that John is winning, and Barton was expecting him to be bought and paid for, he gets angry and orders his outlaws to \"give him the needle\", and make it good and strong.So, John is going to ride \"Dynamite\" the horse, but before he does he examines the saddle and finds, a needle. He removes it and starts his ride. Barton and outlaws figure they've been made and clear out of town. Barton won't help Dolores escape, however, so she goes to tell John (who just won the horse riding competition) that Barton and the gang are robbing the Cattleman's bank. John hurries to intercept. He rides in as they make their escape from the bank and jumps from his horse to tackle two of the outlaws. The sheriff arrives and thinks John is in on the holdup and arrests him. The Marshall arrives, distracting the sheriff long enough for John to make a speedy exit in pursuit of Barton. He catches up to them, then tumble down a cliff and into a river where they duke it out. John brings but fallen Barton back to the posse. He shows the marshal the needle with snake venom and explains that's how the outlaws stopped other competitors at the rodeo.\nBack with the judge, Marshall explains to Marjorie all about the senorita and how it was part of the plan. The judge offers a deputy job to John, but he can't, because he has to plan his honeymoon. The film ends with John and Marjorie in a kiss."

        "summary": "In this blend of documentary and fictional narrative from pioneering filmmaker Robert Flaherty, the everyday trials of life on Ireland's unforgiving Aran Islands are captured with attention to naturalistic beauty and historical detail.",
        "sinopsis": "Vincent Browne profiles the documentary film Man Of Aran, which was first released in 1934 and is now available on video.For the last 200 years the Aran Islands have exercised a powerfully romantic fascination on the outside world which is without equal anywhere else in the country. They were believed to contain the essence of the ancient Irish life, represented by a pure uncorrupted peasant existence centred around the struggle between man and his hostile but magnificent surroundings. This myth, strengthened by the writings of Yeats and especially Synge was hugely expanded by the release in 1934 of Man of Aran, a documentary on the life of the Island people. This film won international acclaim and explained in no small way why so many different nationalities walk the surface of Aran in their thousands between May and October each year.The film was made by renowned American director Robert Flaherty who was already established at the time as having virtually founded the documentary film form. In 1923 he screened his Nanook of the North which was a portrait of the lives of the Eskimo peoples of the Belcher Islands off Canada. This film celebrated the primeval duel between man and Nature which was the central motif in all his later work.The Man of Aran known by the Islanders as simply The Film, was like films such as The African Queen and Orson Welles Othello, capable of generating a huge stock of legends and myths about the making of the movie itself. This happens occasionally, when the production features larger than life figures who provide as much drama off the set as on it. Flaherty's personality was not found wanting in this regard. His island contact man, Pat Mullen, has charted the sometimes ambivalent nature of the director's relationship with the Islanders who were initially suspicious of what were understood as his socialist opinions. These suspicions were enhanced when Flaherty was seen to lead a life of luxury amidst the poverty of the Islands. Harry Watt, a production assistant on the film, felt that the extraordinary thing was that Flaherty lived like a king in these primitive places.......I never lived so well in my life.Flaherty decided that the best means of representing the difficulties and struggles of life on Aran was by placing the family unit, (man, wife and child) at the centre of the film. The casting for these roles, though initially difficult due to the Islanders native fear of alien corruption, was eventually concluded by a mixture of cajolery, priestly reassurance and the promise of payment.The cast eventually featured Mickleen Dillane as the boy, Maggie Dirrane as the woman and the eagle profile of Coleman Tiger King as the man of Aran himself. The barely comprehended project caused problems for some, one woman getting so muddled found that her face was full up entirely of drama which was something of a worry until Pat Mullen advised that a drop of whiskey would solve the problem.Flaherty's mode of working was unusual in that it involved shooting vast quantities of film for each segment. He believed that the camera and the film-maker were fused into a single organic unit in the manner of a novelist and his pen. By completely immersing himself in his environment, Flaherty felt that the most appropriate or truthful images would then naturally emerge. This intuitive style accounted for the huge expenditure of film and explains why it took almost 2 years to shoot. As Joe Mc Mahon, in his excellent article on the film in The Book of Aran tells us:\"All in all he was to shoot over 500,000 feet of film. In one day alone, using two cameras, he shot 5,600 feet\".The film itself is very simple in structure. It portrays the family's attempts to survive the Barren landscape and the mountainous fear that surrounds it. It opens with some peaceful scenes of Mickleen fishing and Maggie tending her baby and looking after the domestic animals. A fishing scene follows which initially takes place in calm seas which soon begin to rage, the family almost losing their stock of fishing nets. We then see man and wife making the earth for a potato crop by laying down seaweed on the bare rock. Meanwhile Mickleen is shown fishing from a precipice at the edge of an immense cliff, an activity which seems suicidally nonchalant. Next follows the centre piece of the film, the prolonged shark hunt, which is followed by the famous final sea scenes which are among the most powerful (and dangerous) ever filmed.The film, when it was released was the cause of some controversy, dealing as it did with the problems of representation and identity. This was a thorny issue for a self-conscious country emerging from centuries of colonial subjugation. The film was presented as a portrayal of contemporary life on the islands but what was actually delivered was a romanticised notion of what life was like in the 19th century almost 100 years before.The practice of shark fishing by harpoon that is the central theme of the film was a practice that had died out almost 90 years previously. The giant shark was hunted for his liver which was a valuable source of high quality lighting oil. This oil was replaced by paraffin and later electricity and the practice died out. Nonetheless, Flaherty needed a central hook upon which to expand his heroic metaphors and Pat Mullen was dispatched to the Claddagh in Galway to find the one surviving fisherman who knew how it had been done in the old days.This section of the film, and the incredible storm scenes at the end, were extremely dangerous, exposing the actors to the very real possibility of having their tiny boat smashed by a blow from the huge tail of the shark or of having the boat dashed on the rocks of the foaming shores. Mullen in his invaluable account of the making of the film (also titled Man of Aran) was more upbeat, finding the dangerous escapades a vindication of the people of the island and their heritage....... \"A great thrill of wild pride shot through me as I looked at them, for here had been a trial of the old, old stock and the blood still ran true\". Flaherty, when interviewed later in his life, said: \"I should have been shot for what I asked these superb people to do, all for the sake of a keg of porter and five pounds a piece\".The film did well commercially despite criticisms that the real issue of island poverty had not been addressed at all. Flaherty claimed that \"he photographed what the camera wanted to photograph\" and that should be the end of it. This belief was justified by the film winning the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival in 1935.The criticisms of the film's accuracy are well founded but as we move into another century the facts of contemporary life in Aran in the 1930's become less important. Flaherty may have been like the newspaper man in Who Shot Liberty Valence?- guilty of believing in the maxim that states: \"When the truth and the legend contradict each other, always print the legend\". This criticism aside, the essence of the film is faithful to the people and the place. By celebrating strength and endurance he acknowledges persistent and lingering Aran values without which the Islanders could never have survived. The images that this remarkable film have given us remain, in the words of Tim Robinson; \"Like grand, sombre court-cards on the table of the mind and will not be brushed aside by subsequent knowledge of the subtle actualities of Aran life\"."

The brain is indeed the instrument of thinking, but the mind is the skilful player that makes it give forth the beautiful harmony of thought It is because of the disastrous results of fear brought not only on the individual but on the nation, that it becomes the duty of every sane man and woman to establish quarantine against fear. Fear is a psychic disease which is highly contagious and extraordinarily infectious. Fear thought is most dangerous when it parades as forethought. Combat fear by replacing it with faith. Resist worry with confidence. --- Wm. S. Sadler, M.D., F.A.C.S., Director of the Chicago Institute of Research and Diagnosis. [William Samuel Sadler (1875-1969), American medicine doctor as psychologist, psychiatrist and surgeon at Chicago for over 60 years, teacher of Psychology at the McCormick Theological Seminary.] Unhealthy thought creates harped attitudes which in turn create criminals and manias. The Chicago Crime Commission made a survey of 10.000 (exact number impossible to read in the video copy; possibly higher multiple of 10.000) convicted criminals and found them all suffering from some mental disease.\"In a laboratory, Dr. Mierschultz (Horace Carpenter) is putting his finishing touches to some chemical mix in a big hypodermic syringe, while his assistant is doing some electric experiences on a strange apparatus. \"Tonight, my dear Maxwell, I'm ready to try my experiment on a human. Yeah In the morgue, there is a little guest suicide.\" Maxwell (Bill Woods aka William Woods) is obviously distressed, \"Have you made arrangements?\"\nThe Doctor is taken aback: \"No! You know that I do not work under prying eyes! You shall find a way for me to work without detection. It is your chance to show me your gratitude for my generosity, and protection!\"\nMaxwell stands up, towering over the sitting Doctor: \"I'll never forget what you have done, and I'd do anything to help you - but the morgue! Dead people! What if I should be caught?\"The Doctor almost spits his answer: \"How many times have you told me of your impersonations, that you never had a chance!... May be now your art will serve you, after all! You have seen the Coroner, why not impersonate him? That's it! Impersonate him! The time has come when you can repay me for what I have done.\"Maxwell tries to plead, but at the same time he voices his disapproval for the old Doctor's experiments: \"To bring back life is not natural,\" he says he has arranged for other guinea-pigs, a dog, and a cat. Satan, the black cat, snarls from his pillow, as on cue.\"Once a ham, always a ham! [meaning, an actor who overacts in a bad way] You, an actor? (derisive smile) But dont forget, my dear Maxwell, the police would be very glad to find you.\"Maxwell looks up at the ceiling, I didn't mean I wouldn't...\" \"Of course not. In time, you may become a great man!\"Both men strip their long white shifts, and leave the laboratory. Satan the black cat is seen on the basement running after a rat, and then a lonely ginger cat.At the morgue, Maxwell in disguise with a monocle, accompanies the undisguised Doctor in the search for a human corpse.The Doctor chooses the body of a beautiful young blonde, \"This is the one here!\" he says, uncovering her head.\nMaxwell reads from a plate on the corpses wrist, \"Number 5-6-9-4-1, Maria Altura, age 24, suicide, carbon monoxide gas, not clean.\"The doctor checks for a heart bit with a stetoscope, then applies an injection in both carotids. \"We have to work fast,\" he says.In the next room, the Embalmer (J.P. Wade) and his assistant are complaining that with so many deaths, and suicides yet, they have to work overtime.The Doctor massages the body's cold arms, and the girl starts moving her head a little. The Doctor decides she must have some oxygen, so they'll bring her outside through a side door.The Embalmer comments to his Assistant that the Coroner is making extra working hours, performing an autopsy on the beauty that had been brought in earlier [insinuating an act of necrophilia].Meanwhile, at the Bureau of Missing Persons, Captain Jones is hearing the deposition of the baldhead Embalmer and the Coroner (Bill Woods in a dual role), about the disappearance of Maria's body; the Embalmer gives a description resembling Dr. Meirschultz. The Coroner admits that the Doctor is a bit strange, but denies the possibibility of him being a body snatcher. Meanwhile, the police receives an official inquest on the whereabouts of Don Maxwell, a vaudeville impersonator by profession, who has disappeared in town. Detective Collins is put in charge of the case.At the laboratory, Dr. Meirschultz is waiting for Maria to recover fully in a few hours. While his assistant is overly impressed with giving back life to a dead person, the Doctor says, \"This is but one step. Cases like these have an element of doubt, but what I want is a victim with a shattered heart! Yes! A heart (There is a pulsating heart, kept in a large bowel on the labs main desk.) - that I may exchange for this thing I've been keeping for years. Ah! Ah! Ah! You! You shall bring it to me, Maxwell. It will be my supreme accomplishment!\"\nThe assistant cowers again at the idea, \"Not from the morgue!...\"But the Doctor is relentless, \"I dont care where you take it from the morgue, the streets, the undertaker! Get going! The end will justify the means.\"Maxwell goes out, rampages through a tunnel into the undertaker's office (looking like the laboratory's basement). Two ginger snarling cats are there fighting (apparently tied to each other by a piece of string). One cat darts between Maxwell's legs, frightening him so that he runs away by the front door. As he runs through a green park, he passes by a white dog versus a black cat fighting on the road.At first, the doctor is displeased on the assistants failure, \"Coward! You are a fool! You've failed me.\" But then, looking at the throbbing heart in the glass jar, he has an idea. He takes a revolver from a drawer, and says, \"Yeah! You have seen the extent of my powers; you have worked with me; you have faith in me. Here, take this (he hands the revolver to him). You'll take your own life, and I'll give it back to you. I'll give you the new heart, and you'll live again. Ah! Ah! Ah! You'll live!... Ah! Ah! Ah! Live!... The assistant shoots. The revolver falls. Dr. Meirschultz hangs briefly to the table, than falls on the floor, dead.DEMENTIA PRAECOX is the next films title, describing the most important of the psychosis, both because it constitutes the highest percentage of mental diseases and because recovery is so extremely rare. Dementia praecox patients show blunting of the emotions, serious defects of judgement, development of fantastic ideas, belief that they are being forced to do things or are being interfered with. [Dementia praecox (precocious madness) is a term first used in 1891 in this Latin form by Arnold Pick (1851-1924), a German professor of psychiatry at Charles University in Prague.]Maxwell inspects the doctors notes, to find the formula to bring him back to life, only to find there is none. [Montage of a laughing Pluto and his minions, from the film _Maciste in Hell (1924)_ (qv).] Mrs. Buckley (Phyllis Diller; not the TV comedienne) comes for urgent consultation with the doctor, for her husband is having a delusion of being a killer ape. She is prepared to wait, but demands to see the doctor. Maxwell, under strain and not wishing to give away his crime, turns to his old box of Make-up Artist, adds a wig and the doctor's eye-glasses, and comes to a resolution: Meirschultz would be missed - Maxwell never would! So, he impersonates the Doctor (figuratively commiting the suicide the Doctor had ordered him to do).\nMaxwell talking in a strong voice, tries to convince himself of the perfect impersonation: \"Not only do I look like Meirschultz, I am doctor Meirschultz! (bulging his biceps) I'll be a great man!\"APARESIS is the general paralysis of the insane the most serious disorder for the criminologist. There is marked failure of memory, poor retention, impaired judgement, and failure on the part of the patient to curb his primitive tendencies. -- according to a text quoted from Philip A. Parsons, Ph.D., Crime and Criminal.As Maxwell progresses in his insanity, he is unable to cope with the injection he is preparing in the lab for Mr. Buckley (Ted Edwards) who fancies himself as a killer ape; instead of giving him an injection of water, which would do no harm (?!), he administers a dose of \"super-adrenaline.\" \"Do you feel better?\" he asks.\nMr. Buckley contorts himself in pain, speaking out his suffering and twisting his body, feeling fire in his brain. The wife is worried, \"Doctor... he doesn't seem to be getting better, but worse!\" and, \"Doctor, what was in that hypo?\"\nBuckley frightens his wife, who tumbles into the laboratory, then he jumps at the fake doctor, overpowering him and throwing him to the ground easily despite being a smaller man.Maria Altura, in a long, white negligee, walks in from behind a folding screen, and is immediately abducted.\nMrs. Buckley, trying to raise from the floor, sees the late Meirschultz's corpse hid behind the desk, and shouts, \"Doctor! What have you done? This looks like murder!...\"\nHe denies, and tries to convince her that it was his assistant who had shot himself. But then, he commits a \"lapsus linguae\", and says that he killed him to bring him back to life with his experiments.Meanwhile, Maria Altura is being stripped to the waist in an apparent swoon, as Mr. Buckley keeps walking through a wood, screeching like an ape. [The topless stand-in is a brunette with very long hair.]\nMrs. Buckley sums the situation up: \"Doctor, I've heard of uncanny experiments but this tops them all. But I think we speak the same language... Am I right? When youll bring your assistant back to life, he will do as you direct. You can do the same with my husband. Only he will do... as I direct.\"In the woods, Buckley is upon his victim, apparently strangling her to death, or worse. Maxwell decides he must bring the real doctor back, but first, he has to find out the formula. Maxwell is distracted again, this time by his neighbor, a man who was calling after two of his cats that had escaped from the house. Maxwell denies using cats for his experiments, stating, \"I think too much of Satan to use cats for experiments.\"Meanwhile, in the laboratory, Satan had got out of his favorite pillow, overturned the jar, and eaten the heart [in a heavily cut scene]. Maxwell is undecided about his priorities, and now decides to dispose of the body. He carries the corpse downstairs to the basement. While he works feverishly to hide the corpse behind a wall of bricks, he sees Satan spying on him from the stairs, and chases the cat mounting the steps cat-like. Finally he corners Satan, grabs forcefully at the animals head and pressing with his thumbs, he dislodges the cats left eyeball.\n[The stand-in cat for Satan is the ginger cat seen earlier, who had been a one-eyed cat before this scene.] Once free, the stand-in cat jumps against a glass window, breaking it, and disappears.When Maxwell looks down and finds the cat's eyeball on the ground, he compares it to an oyster, or a grape, \"But the gleam is gone! Ah! Ah! Ah!\" And eats it. Then, he returns to the basement, and finishes sealing Dr. Meirschultz's body inside the brick wall of his basement.PARANOIAC This is an extremely rare but very serious disease. Characteristics of it are fixed suspicions, persecutory delusions. The paranoiac is often particularly dangerous because of the difficulty of detecting his disease.Distracted by his inner phantasms, Maxwell stops adding bricks to the wall for a moment, just in time for Satan to dart inside, joining his late owner. Next morning, Detective Collins is the neighborhood asking questions, first from a woman sweeping her front porch, and then a Man who has a cat breeding farm; nothing useful comes out of it, except that shots were heard but were not reported, and that may be they were not heard at all.\nCat Breeder Neighbor: \"I have everything figured out. You see, rats breed faster than cats; cats skins make good furs; cats eats rats; and rats eat raw meat; but that means they eat the carcass of the cats. So, the rats eat the cats, the cats eat the rats, and I get the skins...\"\nDetective Collins: \"Rats eating cats! Well, that IS news.\"\nCat Breeder Neighbor: (Gleeful) \"Simple ain't it...\"\nDetective: \"Did you hear any gunshots last night?\" Cat Breeder Neighbor: \"I dunno...\"Maxwell had forgotten all about his wife, and her, him - until...\nThis films inter-title introduces a living room with three young women in various degrees of undress, plus Maizie (Jenny Dark), a blonde who wants to be clean, and is taking her time in the adjoining bathroom. Alice Maxwell (Theo Ramsey) is a plump silver blonde who rents the apartment (and looks and speaks like Mae West); Jo (Celia McCann) is a pretty, long haired brunette with a funny, shrill voice; and Marvel (Marvel Andre) is a beautiful young blonde, in knickers and skin-color bra, doing gymnastics. The brunette is ironing some underwear, Alice takes off her dark robe and is using an electric equipment to massage her buttocks and belly, while Maizie who had changed her bath towel for a flimsy negligee sits, reading the newspaper. Then, Maizie reads from the newspaper that some man died in Australia, living a fortune to his nephew, Maxwell, a well known impersonator artist who has disappeared. With good reason, Alice remembers her fugitive husband, and that the last she heard of him, he was staying with that good professor...[There's a cut scene, in which detective Collins informs Mrs. Buckley that her husband has been found in a very serious condition, near a dying woman, and that Dr. Meirschultz is suspect of wrong doing. She tells a false story about what had taken place at the laboratory, covering up both for her husband, and for the Doctor.]Alice goes to Dr. Meirschultz's and is received by her husband in disguise; she tells him that Maxwell has inherited a fortune, and she wants to reunite with him. He dismisses her, saying that her husband will be there by 8 p.m.MANIC DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSIS is the lead of the next piece of scientific text. There are three phases of the manic-depressive psychosis: the manic phase, the depressed phase, and the mixed phase. In the manic phase, ideas come so rapidly that there is no time to select the proper reaction and judgement accordingly appears impaired. Such patients are often liable to commit sex offenses.There's a moment of fantasy, in which the false Doctor fancies to be kissing a young, long haired Brunette Patient, who had come to him for an injection. She is seen wearing only large cotton knickers, peering from behind a folding screen; and then, sitting on a table covered with a white bedsheet, incongruously wrapped up in a black negligee. [She is the stand-in for Maria Altura in the rape scene.]Next, Don Maxwell, speaking to himself, is fascinated with the gleam in the Patient's eyes, and he recalls the gleam in Mrs. Buckley's eyes, and concludes that it means she wanted to kill her husband. The same gleam in Alice's eyes means that she wanted to kill him, when she came searching for Maxwell. \"She wants to murder me thats what she wants to do!\" (The long clawed hands of Pluto and other devils reappear in an insert, superimposed to the scene.) He forms a plan to get rid of both women.He starts by telling Mrs. Buckley that she must help him, that Mrs. Maxwell (Thea Ramsey) is crazy, and she'll be here any minute. She thinks I murdered her husband! To prevent her from going to the police with such an accusation, he needs help. \"Down in the basement, there is a secret vault! We will put her down there. You will quieten her by jabbing this in her arm (placing an hypodermic syringe in Mrs. Buckley's right hand), and in the meantime, I'll go get Buckley.\"\n\"It sounds alright - except the fact that she's crazy,\" objects Buckley's wife.Footsteps announce the approaching Alice Maxwell, and the false doctor dismisses the woman's objection lightly, sending her to the next room.In his interview with Alice, Maxwell tells her that her husband told him he was ready to go with her to get the inheritance, but first there is a dangerous woman in the next room, who puts both their lives in danger. \"I will take her to a room downstairs, I will give her a shot, and you'll take care of her until I'm back.\"\n\"What about me getting help? (listening) She is quiet now, isn't she?\"Maxwell cuts in, \"Yeah, but she can break up any minute. She is not afraid of a woman, so if she happens to get wild, just shove this into her arm. (placing an hypodermic needle in her hand) Keep it, and all will be well.\"\nMaxwell puts his hands on his wife's shoulder, as he walks her to the adjoining room. He enters first, and says in an unnecessary high voice: \"Alright, Mrs. Buckley. We'll go downstairs now, I've a special treatment down there!...\"The fortyish woman goes in front, wearing long coat and a design hat, plus a fox fur wrapped around her neck and a large ring in her middle finger, followed shortly by Alice, wearing dark jacket and long skirt and a hat. They had not time to see each other, and as they go down the staircase to the basement, Mrs. Buckley, turns around a couple of times trying to see the twenty-something woman behind her. Her husband follows her, but then he quickly turns back, closing the trap door on both women, who suddenly find themselves in the dark basement, alone with a candle light and a couple of rats.Fear leads them to lose control, and to attack each other wildly. The screaming will be heard all through the entire sequence, and despite they are closed in a basement without walls, the noise can be heard in the laboratory, too. Mrs. Buckley screams, and turns around, hitting Mrs. Maxwell's arm, who loses her syringe that rolls between the feet of the entangled pair. Alice jumps at the other woman, grabbing her arms and making her lose her hold in her own hypo. [The syringes with the deadly venom will be seen occasionally on the floor, but never re-taken.] They shove each other around, then Alice tries to strangle the older woman.\nUpstairs, Maxwell is going even more mad, and laughing maniacally (insert images of clawed hands reappear).\nThe Cat Breeder neighbor comes to spy through a window, and disappears in fear of the look on the false doctors face.Alice goes down on her rump, but as she is grabbing her attackers arms, she has the leverage to get up on the rebound as Buckley stands back. Alice throws down Buckley's wife, and looks for some kind of weapon in the filthy basement, plunged into darkness, and rat infested. The older woman is fast to get up, and goes after Alice, who turns around to face her foe. Face to face, they grab each others by the neck, strangling each other. In the fierce struggle, both disentangle their necks, and slap each other to face and body. The older woman wrestles Alice down, and pulls her jacket, effectively stripping it off the jacket of the blonde, leaving her in a white shirt, that she rips with her clawing fingers. Alice goes down twice, and stands up again, her breathing hard, coming to hands again with the other woman. This time, Alice springs up from the floor, and the two women engage in a double head-lock, going down together, first hard, on their knees, then twisting sideways, slumping to the floor in a close embrace, and rolling around for a moment. Alice seems to dominate the fight, staying on top for a moment, and punching her foe twice. she forces Mrs. Buckley in a tight clinch, both grabbing the opponents neck to breaking point, and tumble and roll entwined and screeching. Alice disengages, and applies a couple of punches to the fallen foe.In the night, three cops on motorcycles precede a 1927 Studebaker Commander police car, all sirens on - possibly called by the curious neighbor.In the down and dirty room, the two women keep on their fight; Alice shoves Buckley onto her back against some boxes in a corner, punches her and, as Buckley screams out in pain and disoriented, Alice gets a baseball bat from behind her, and bashes it onto Mrs. Buckley's head - missing, and hitting the wall instead. The second blow is more effective, but delivered by a very tired arm. (Insert of a flying pidgeon.) Buckley manages to stand-up and punch Alice, who falls against a shelf full of glass jars and laboratory equipment. The shelves fall on Alice's head, knocking her out momentarily, and the vials break up noisily on the ground.The police vehicles stop by Dr. Meirschultz's place, and two detectives and two uniformed cops go in without knocking on the door. Mrs. Buckley grabs the stunned Mrs. Maxwell by the scruff of her neck with her left hand, and proceeds to strangle her with her right. Alice is almost finished, as her foe stands, picks up a flower pot, and bashes her head with it. Alice still has strength to scream out loud enough to be heard upstairs by the police.\nOn hearing the woman's scream, Inspector Jones gets inquisitive.Maxwell candidly enough, assumes its two of his patients who are battling it out in the basement.\n\"What kind of place is this, anyway?\" asks the detective.\nMaxwell, trying to explain it in a few words, argues that \"These women have the gleam!\"\nThe detective finds the way to the basement and goes down, followed by the two cops forcing the mad man between them.When the police arrive, the two women are on their knees, still fighting. A police in uniform grabs Buckleys arms, and pulls her off Alice and towards the staircase. The plainclothes detective helps Mrs. Maxwell up and holds her in the opposite corner.The policemen ear another scream from behind the brick wall, and since the fake doctor is not offering any sensible explanation, they bring the wall down. The doctor is there all right, and moving; but that's because of Satan the cat that is standing on his right shoulder. Satan jumps away, and the corpse falls forward, breaking the rest of the brick wall. The film ends with a last scientific textCOMPLEX: Manias are created by inability to adjust to the world as it is. Insanity is our defense against a world which is not of our making or to our liking. The normal person can make such an adjustment. It is not always easy, but it is being done constantly. The person of inferior mental capacity can not do this. He therefore creates a world in his mind which is his own idea of the world of his choice. He retreats to this world whenever the other world becomes unbearable. This explains the periods of rationalism all mental cases have. The periods of rationalism depends upon the unbearableness of the real world. There are many people of sound mind who find one particular thing unbearable. When this is the case, he is said to be a victim of such a complex.Maxwell is more calm now, behind bars - and he starts a speech on insanity recalling the gleam! He claims he did not want to be a criminal, he only wanted \"...to amuse, to entertain. Dr. Meirschult'z is my brilliant impersonation!\""

Mary gets a job at the Cafe Roma, where Giulio Monteverdi, a famous vocal coach, hears her sing. Giulio promises to make Mary a star if she will allow him to control her life. He also tells her that there cannot be any romance between the two of them, as that would distract from the process of growing her talent. Mary discovers she has stagefright as she prepares for a tour of provincial opera houses, however Giulio helps her overcome it.Years later, still under Giulio's tutelage, Mary begins to tire of his dominance and discipline. The two meet one of Giulio's old pupils, Lally (Mona Barrie), while in Vienna. Lally once tried to be romantic with Giulio, but was rejected. This past history renders Mary jealous and she pretends to have laryngitis. Mary thinks Giulio has gone to Lally to rekindle a romance, and so visits Bill Houston (Lyle Talbot), a longtime friend who has proposed marriage. In a jealous huff, Mary decides not to sing that night in order to punish Giulio. Giulio realizes what is going on and tells Mary that Lally will replace her on stage, but then proposes to Mary.She decides to go on, and Mary's performance of Bizet's Carmen wins her an invitation to the Metropolitan Opera, her dream venue. Giulio, however, still does not believe that she is ready for such a venue. Later at dinner, Lally lies to Mary by telling her that she is still involved with Giulio. On the night of her debut in Madame Butterfly, Mary is too nervous to go on stage until she sees Giulio in his usual place in the prompter's box."

        "sinopsis": "John Travers is a U.S. marshal who, along with his Indian assistant Yak, are looking for some wanted criminals somewhere in the untamed West. Posing as the Lone Rider, Travers appears to rob a stagecoach; however, he is only setting up a sting where he can prevent the actual robbery and capture a pair of highwaymen. In the process he also rescues the attractive young female occupant of the stagecoach, who happens to be the niece of a town leader. When Travers arrives in town with the injured stage driver and the young lady, the citizens come out to see what is happening. In the group is Al Davis, who has that same day just been named the new sheriff of the town. While the townfolks are talking to Travers a sniper kills Davis on the spot. Travers does not reveal he is a U.S. marshal, however he volunteers to be their sheriff.Travers rides out to recover the money he \"stole\" earlier. Meanwhile an unseen bad guy known as the Shadow gives his henchmen orders from a secret room, communicating through a hole in the wall disguised as a safe. They are assigned to do away with Sheriff Travers. Between the hero and his sidekick Yak, they keep one step ahead of the bad guys, repeatedly foiling their attempts to murder our lawman. Travers and Yak eventually locate a mountain hideout that contains numerous hardened fugitives whose activities are orchestrated by the Shadow.The Shadow is Matt Matlock, a town leader who all believe to be a decent person. In fact he is not even really Matt Matlock, but a criminal who sometime recently killed a rancher named Matt Matlock and assumed his identity. Matlock's niece Anita, the girl rescued earlier in the stagecoach, whose father was Matt Matlock's brother and co-owner of the ranch, came to town to see the ranch she inherited a 50% share in after her father's death. Unbeknownst to her, her father was also killed by the Shadow. Having never seen her uncle she does not know the man she is staying with is a criminal. Shadow/Matlock tries to carry out the charade of kindly uncle, but at the same time arranges some disturbances at night, such as a fiendish face at the window and a man in a bear costume, to scare away Miss Matlock. She doesn't scare easily, though, and takes a potshot at the prowlers, quickly ending their pranks.Travers and Yak discover the secret room from which the Shadow conducts his business in town, as well as a hollowed out tree stump that served as the hideout for the earlier sniper. This greatly helps them bring their investigation to the point where Travers reveals who he really is, and swears in a bunch of local ranchers as deputies to form a legal posse and go after the Shadow gang. Meanwhile Matlock's old cook tells Anita that the man she thinks is her uncle is a murderous imposter. She rides off toward town to break the news, but is captured by the gang on the way. The gang has acquired a machine gun, and they all head out to do away with Travers and his do-gooders. A prolonged chase and shootout ensues. The surviving members of the Shadow gang are all justly captured.Travers and Anita have been making eyes at each other throughout the story, and the epilogue reveals that they fall in love, get married and live on the ranch with Yak, and raise a family."

        "sinopsis": "Famous New York detective Nick Charles met and fell in love with Nora, an heiress from an old upper-class family, decided to quit his job, moved to San Francisco and started a life of merriment, childish pranks and non-stop drinking.For one of their vacations, Nick took Nora back to New York to visit old friends, just in time to get tangled up as old friend Clyde Wynant (a thin middle-aged businessman) was discovered to be missing - thus suspected of murdering girlfriend Julia Wolf and kidnapping ex-wife Mimi's new husband Chris Jorgenson.Very much in love with his wife and having immense fun with the newfound leisure life, Nick had no intention of playing the detective. Unfortunately, everyone thought otherwise. After being chased around by reporters, shot at by a gangster (Joe Morelli), constantly harrassed by Wynant's family, and incessantly ridiculed by Nora, Nick finally decided to pick up his detective hat again - just so that people would leave him alone!Adopting the manner of a happy-go-lightly drunk, Nick found out that no one had seen Clyde for over 3 months. His lawyer MacCaulay would receive phone calls instructing him to give large sums of money to Julia, who claimed that she saw him often and was acting on his orders. But Julia was suspected to be not only cheating on Clyde, but also stealing from him, for gangster boyfriend Joe Morelli.And the Wynant family was as happy as Nick last left them. Clyde's affair with Julia gave wife Mimi good grounds for divorce and endless opportunities to pester him for money; even after her marriage to Chris Jorgenson, a penniless man living off his wife and her ex-husband's money. Clyde's son Gilbert was an eccentric bookworm, with little thoughts for his own family. His daughter Dorothy was close to him, and engaged to be married to Tommy. Dorothy was having a secret struggle with Mimi and was the first Wynant to come and ask for Nick's help.Mimi had gone to see Julia on the day she died, and was the first to find her dead. Mimi recognised the watch chain Julia held in her hand to be Clyde's, and was keeping it to blackmail him. Knowing that Mimi was devoted to Chris, Nick used Chris' disappearance and coerced her into giving up the watch chain.Lacking conclusive evidence to prove his theory, Nick pretended to take his terrier Asta for an evening walk and sneaked into Clyde's shop. He caught the bookkeeper Tanner, an ex-con once arrested by him, sneaking into the store. But Asta caught something better - a dead body buried beneath the store floor.Based on the clothes worn by the skeleton, the police deducted that the skeleton was a fat man by the name of Rosengreen, known adversary of Clyde's, and released the findings to the reporters.Now that all the suspects had let down their guard, Nick put on the real show. He hosted a dinner party, where all the guests were \"escorted\" by police cars and half of the waiters were police officers. So arrived the distressed guests: the Wynant family and Tommy, Jorgenson and the real Mrs. Jorgenson, Joe Morelli and girlfriend Marion, Tanner, and MacCaulay.Over dinner, and his signature never-empty cocktail glasses, Nick revealed that the skeleton was Clyde, the murderer had purposedly dressed the dead body in large size clothing to fool the police. The murderer then conspired with Julia to steal all of Wynant's money.Everything was going well until Mimi decided to go see Julia, about how the two of them working together to squeeze Clyde for more money. Worried that Julia may double-cross him, the murderer killed Julia and coerced Mimi into giving fake testimonies about having met Clyde, in exchange for all the money she can ask for.Nick pointed out to Mimi that as Jorgenson was after her money and didn't legally divorce the first Mrs. Jorgenson, her marriage to Jorgenson was not valid; therefore, she was no longer excluded from Clyde's will. Seeing that she could gain more money by telling the truth, Mimi was about to give out all secrets when a shot was fired - by MacCaulay.Freed from the nightmare of being a murderer's daughter, Dorothy married Tommy and the two headed off to their honeymoon. Nick, Nora and Asta also left on the same train - back to their peaceful, idle life in San Francisco."

The film can be subdivided into a number of sequences documenting arrivals, parades, preparations and speeches. Only one scenethe review of the German cavalryactually involved the German military. Characteristic of all the sequences are beautifully composed shots of Nazi flags and symbols, and of faces of enraptured people. Except during the speeches, there is martial music playing by a military band.[1] An airplane is flying through beautiful clouds, then over the city of Nuremberg, and lands at the airport. Nazi party bigwigs descend, finally Adolf Hitler, and there is a welcoming ceremony.[2] Adolf Hitler enters the city, standing in an open four door Mercedes Benz in a motorcade. Adoring crowds wave and give the Nazi salute, including children, women, uniformed soldiers. A woman hands him a bouquet of flowers while holding up a small child in her other arm. Flags with swastikas are flying or hanging on every street.[3] At a rally in a large indoor venue, the party faithful members hear speeches by a dozen party bigwigs. Only a couple of sound bytes from each are shown, ending with a brief speech by Hitler.[4] Night falls on the city of Nuremberg. There are parades through the old streets by small groups carrying torches. Patriotic songs are sung.[5] Dawn over the city. Aerial views of the quiet streets.[6] At an enormous campground of tents, young adult men are getting up, washing in communal basins. Breakfast is being prepared in enormous vats. They eat and sing and play good natured games, with lots of smiles all around.[7] At the enormous stadium built by the Nazis in Nuremberg, the crowds march in and sit and wait for a speech by Hitler.[8] There is a youth rally at another enormous venue, with another speech by Hitler.[9] Military parades follow. In fields outside the city, motorized and cavalry troups display their equipment in marches and advances. Then various military groups each in a different uniform march through the old part of the city, past the Cathedral. In a square next to the Cathedral Hitler reviews the marching groups.[10] Speech by Hitler to military groups.[11] Night falls again, there are fireworks and parades by torch bearing groups.[12] In another motorcade, Hitler is hailed by the populace. Many observe from windows opening onto the motorcade route. Others hail him after having climbed onto any high place, even up lamp posts.[13] In the same venue of the first speeches, Hitler gives a speech closing the proceedings. This speech, just like all the others documented, have no programs or explanations but are designed to create enthusiasm for a new Germany, united, that can do extraordinary things, that can solve problems and build for a better future, where the ordinary worker is treated with dignity, and all are motivated by patriotic love for the German nation."

Through intensive training, Oscar transforms his protégée into the actress \"Lily Garland\", and both she and the play are resounding successes. Over the next three years, their partnership spawns three more smash hits, and Lily is recognized as a transcendent talent.Then Lily tries to break off their professional and personal relationship, fed up with Oscar's over-possessiveness and control of every aspect of her life. Oscar talks her out of it, promising to be more trusting and less controlling in the future. Instead, he secretly hires a private detective agency run by McGonigle to watch her every move, even to the point of tapping her telephone. When she finds out, it is the last straw; she leaves for Hollywood and soon becomes a big movie star.Without Lily, Oscar produces flop after flop. After one such disappointment, to avoid being imprisoned for his debts, he is forced to disguise himself to board the luxurious Twentieth Century Limited train traveling from Chicago to New York City's Grand Central Terminal. By chance, Lily Garland boards the train at a later stop with her boyfriend George Smith (Ralph Forbes). After prevaricating, Oscar sees a chance to restore his fortunes and salvage his relationship with Lily.Oscar schemes to get her to sign a contract with him. However, Lily wants nothing more to do with him. She is on her way to see Oscar's rival (and former employee), Max Jacobs (Charles Lane), to star in his play. However, Oscar manages to get George to break up with her. Knowing that Lily offers him one last chance at professional success he tells her of his wish for her to play Mary Magdalene in his new play; \"sensual, heartless, but beautiful - running the gamut from the gutter, to glory - can you see her Lily? - the little wanton ending up in tears at the foot of the cross. I'm going to have Judas strangle himself with her hair.\" Then Oliver thinks he has found somebody to finance Oscar's project, fellow passenger Mathew J. Clark (Etienne Girardot), not realizing that Clark is a harmless escapee from a mental asylum. When Oscar is slightly wounded in a scuffle with Clark, he pretends to be dying and gets a distraught Lily to sign his contract. The film ends with their first rehearsal, where Oscar reverts to his usual self, domineering a desperate Lily."

        "sinopsis": "Canadian Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is at a London music hall. While watching a demonstration of the fabulous powers of recall of \"Mr. Memory\" (Wylie Watson) gun shots are fired. In the ensuing panic, a frightened Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) holds on to Hannay and talks him into taking her back to his flat. After the bus ride there, she admits that she is a counterspy, and that she fired the shots to cause confusion because she is being chased by assassins, who are standing outside on the street. She claims to know of a plot to steal vital British military secrets, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from his little finger. To stop the plot, she needs to go to Scotland to a large house in a small village. She mentions \"thirty-nine steps\", but does not explain their meaning.That night, Annabella is stabbed in the back but manages to warn him to flee before dying. She is clutching in her hand a map of Scotland with a tiny village circled. To sneak out of the watched flat he borrows the uniform of a milkman and soon boards the Flying Scotsman train to Scotland. He learns from a fellow passenger's newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt as a murder suspect of Annabella Smith. To throw police searching the train off his track, he enters a compartment and engages in an extended kiss with the only occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), and the searchers see them and bypass the compartment. She however frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen when they come back. The train Is stopped on the Forth rail bridge after having the emergency brake triggered by the police when Hannay jumps onto the bridge and escapes.The fugitive stays the night with a poor crofter (farmer) (John Laurie) and his young wife (Peggy Ashcroft), who realizes from a newspaper article that Hannay is on the run, but keeps quiet. The next morning, the husband is about to turn him in to a search party but he runs, aided the wife, wearing the farmer's dark Sunday coat. He arrives on foot at his target village and calls at a large estate occupied by recent arrivals in the area. A large party is going on, he gives the name Annabella Smith to the maid, and the master of the house and the maid lie to the police about seeing a stranger. When Hanay tells his story to the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle), Jordan reveals that he is missing the top joint of his baby finger. Jordan shoots Hannay, but luckily, the bullet is stopped by the farmer's hymnbook that was left in a coat pocket.Hannay drives to the local sheriff after stealing the professor's car, but the sheriff and police refuse to believe his story about Jordan who has befriended them. Hannay is arrested for the London murder. Hannay breaks through a glass window and mingles as a member of a passing parade. He escapes into a door in an alley and finds himself at a political meeting, and is mistaken for the introductory speaker arriving a bit late. Without knowing a thing about the candidate he is introducing he improvises a rousing speech when he sees Pamela enter the hall. Hannay talks about a world in which no one is unjustly accused, no one is hunted and no nation plots against nation.He is recognized by Pamela, who alerts two men she believes are police. Hannay is handcuffed and both he and Pamela taken away to the police station in a car. Pamela notices they pass the police station and the captors say they are going to another police station in another town. When Pamela notices they have missed the turn to the town, Hannay realizes they are not the police. He proves his theory by looking for a reaction from his captors when he mentions their boss has a missing joint from his finger. When a flock of sheep blocks the narrow road, one of the henchmen handcuffs Hannay to Pamela and the captors exit the car and attempt to move the sheep. Hannay escapes, dragging the unwilling woman along. Hannay and the attached Pamela evade the spies by hiding under a bridge covered with sheep at one point and behind a waterfall at another.They walk across the countryside and stay the night at an inn, Pamela still doesn't believe Hannay's story even though he tries his best to convince her. The couple hide their handcuffs by pretending to be a lovers unable to keep their hands off each other. The innkeeper's wife believes they are a runaway couple in love, and lies to protect them when the fake police show up and make inquiries as to who is staying at the inn. There are awkward comedic moments when Pamela takes off her wet stockings and they lie on the bed handcuffed. While he sleeps, she manages to slip out of her handcuff. On her escape, she overhears one of the fake policemen speaking on the telephone downstairs and the conversation confirms Hannay's story. She returns to the room and sleeps on a sofa.The next morning, Pamela tells Hannay what she overheard including the fact that the spy's are heading to London. Pamela calls Scotland Yard before leaving Scotland and then visits them when she gets to London. Scotland Yard has investigated the tale of the spy plot. No secret documents have been reported missing however, so she is not believed. Instead, they let her leave and follow her to find Hannay.Pamela goes to meet Hannay at Mr. Memory's show at the London Palladium, finds him, and sits next to him. Hannay observes Professor Jordan in a box. As the performer is introduced, Hannay recognizes his theme music - it's an annoyingly catchy tune he hasn't been able to forget for days. Hannay puts two and two together and realizes that the spies are using Mr. Memory as the means to smuggle the secrets out: he has them memorized so there are no paper documents. As the police take Hannay into custody, he shouts out a question: \"What are the 39 Steps?\" Mr. Memory compulsively begins to answer, \"The Thirty-Nine Steps is an organization of spies, collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of....\" Suddenly, Jordan shoots him and tries to flee, but he is quickly apprehended. The dying Mr. Memory recites the information stored in his brain, formulas for the design of a silent aircraft engine. The final shot shows Hannay, with his handcuff still on, holding hands with Pamela."

Both lived, and went on to even stranger misadventures than before.We flashback to scenes from Frankenstein (1931) (1931), which lead up to our new story. After the mill collapses, and it seems the Monster has been destroyed, the burgomeister (E.E. Clive) urges everyone to return to their homes. But the father (Reginald Barlow) of the little girl whom the Monster had killed (accidentally) in the first film, wants to see the creature's dead body with his own eyes before he can have peace. His wife (Mary Gordon) tries to stop him; but when the man wanders through the still-burning debris, he falls through a hole that leads to a flooded cavern below the mill. The Monster rises out of the water and kills the poor man, later doing the same for his wife. The Frankensteins' hysterical servant Minnie (Una O'Connor) also meets with the Monster, but manages to escape with her life. But no one believes her when she screeches that the Monster is still on the loose.Henry wants nothing more than to settle into a peaceful life with his new bride (Valerie Hobson). But his old professor, the sinister Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger), now disgraced, appears unexpectedly and convinces him to continue his work of creating new life. Pretorius has been conducting his own experiments but can do no better than to create people who are a few inches tall.Soon the village learns that the Monster is still alive. They capture him, but the powerful creature escapes his prison and goes wandering through the forest as the villagers hunt him.The Monster discovers an isolated cabin occupied by an old blind hermit (O.P. Heggie) who is playing the violin. The creature and the lonely hermit soon become friends, as the old man teaches the Monster the joys of music, cigars, bread and wine. The Monster understands human speech and soon learns to speak himself. They've both finally found happiness, which is dashed when two travelers stop by to ask directions. They recognize the Monster and attack him, inadvertently burning down the hermit's cabin in the battle. The Monster runs away, miserable once again.A chance meeting in a tomb brings Dr. Pretorius and the Monster together; and Pretorius uses the Monster to kidnap Mrs. Frankenstein and blackmail Henry into returning to his castle and continuing his experiments. The Monster wants his creator to build him a friend; and Pretorius wants to see dead tissue become a living woman. Henry is forced to give his creature a bride.Henry and Pretorius succeed in following the creation of Man with the creation of Woman (Elsa Lanchester again). But Woman is not happy with Man and backs away from him, hissing in horror and fear. The Monster is despondent. He frees Henry and his wife, and then releases a lever that blows the castle to atoms, thus destroying himself, his bride and Dr. Pretorius.Well, not quite. In the next film, Son of Frankenstein (1939) (1939), we learn that the Monster has managed to survive yet again."

        "summary": "Bob Gordon is staging a new Broadway Show. He gets an offer of money by Lillian, if she can dance in his show. Gordon's old class mate Irene, tries to get the leading role in this show, but Lillian insists in getting this part herself.",
        "sinopsis": "The film opens with a radio broadcast where Harry Stockwell (himself) sings an excerpt of \"Broadway Melody,\" which had been introduced in the first film of the Broadway Melody series, followed by Frances Langford (herself) crooning \"You Are My Lucky Star,\" one of this film's most famous songs. When her vocal concludes, Bert Keeler (Jack Benny), an obnoxious gossip columnist from the World Tribune, presents his column radio-style, but all he talks about is who is having a baby. Back at the newspaper office, his editor forbids any more writing about babies and tells him to dig up some dirt or else. In his office, Keelers assistant, Snoop (Sid Silvers), sees theatrical producer, Bob Gordon (Robert Taylor), dancing with the wealthy widow, Lillian Brent (June Knight), on a rooftop across the street. She offers to finance Gordons new show and appeals to him to not forget about her while he works on his show. That leads into the song \"I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling\" sung by Bob and Lillian (later at an audition for Bobs show, Frances Langford sings a short reprise of the song). During their rendition, flowers, furniture, a piano, and a table complete with a meal, magically pop out of the floor. A girls chorus sings and watches Basil (Nick Long, Jr.), Bobs assistant, tap. He magically makes the white clad girls disappear and replaces them with the same group of girls dressed in black. Basil performs a very acrobatic dance before he dances with Lillian. The girls chorus sings again as the number ends with Lillian and Bob at the bar. After watching all of this, Bert Keeler quickly surmises that \"any time a wealthy Park Avenue widow gets chummy with a Broadway guy, one of them's got something the other wants.\" In the next scene, Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) arrives at Bobs office. She explains to his secretary, Kitty Corbett (Una Merkel), that she and Bob had been high school sweethearts five years ago in their hometown of Albany. Keeler comes to Bob's office after a scoop, but instead encounters a man whose talent was snoring (Robert Wildhack), which he gladly demonstrates. For some unknown reason, this snoring man is a recurring annoyance several times during the film. When Bob breezes into his office, he doesnt recognize Irene. As Irene is unpacking in her newly rented tenement apartment, she hears tap dancing on the roof and goes to investigate. She finds Ted (Buddy Ebsen) and Sally (Vilma Ebsen), a brother and sister act, preparing to eat breakfast at noon. Ted tells her it's cheaper to eat that way. While waiting for their coffee to brew, the duo performs an exuberant song and tap dance routine to \"Sing Before Breakfast.\" When it ends, Irene applauds and is invited to join them. After introductions, Ted says he doesnt believe in bad luck taboos like walking under a ladder and singing before breakfast. After some more singing, the long-legged Irene performs a solo. All three join in the fun again and sing and dance their exit. When Bob's secretary helps him remember Irene, he orders Kitty to find her, so she convinces Snoop to ask Keeler to print in his column that Bob is looking for Irene. The wealthy widow, Lillian, burst into Bob's office furious about Keeler's less-than-flattering column about their relationship. Bob dashes down to the columnists office to punch him (similar to the recurrence of the snoring man, Bob punching Keeler occurs several times during the film). Ted and Sally show Keeler's next column about Bob looking for her to Irene, but she stubbornly refuses to see him again, however, she eventually relents and shows up at the audition for the show. Bob takes her aside and discourages her from getting mixed up in the sordid show business world. When he is called to his office, Irene is left sitting alone in the audience. She imagines what it would be like to sing and dance in the theater (\"You Are My Lucky Star,\" Miss Powell's vocals were dubbed by Marjorie Lane). During the number, Irene dances in a ballet in toe shoes. Back in Bob's office, Lillian, his wealthy backer, now wants to be the show's leading lady. To be a success, he thinks the show needs a star, but promises if he can't find one in two weeks he'll allow Lillian to star. Bob leaves for the West Coast to search for his star.\nKeeler suggests to Kitty that Bob get LaBelle Arlette, a French actress he invented, as his star. Keeler continues the charade by building his invention up in his columns and on his radio show; he even rents a room for her at the Hotel Carlton. When Bob returns empty handed from his Hollywood venture, Kitty tells him about LaBelle Arlette and asks why he doesn't hire her. Bob gives Ted and Sally parts in his production and sends Irene back to Albany by train, but she gets off the train to meet Kitty; they have something cooked up.\nIn the next scene, Ted and Sally perform a dress rehearsal of their number in Bob's show, \"On a Sunday Afternoon,\" a Gay Nineties-type number. Just as Gordon gives in to Lillian's demands to star, Irene shows up at his office as LaBelle Arlette; Bob doesn't recognize her again. He quickly signs her for his show. When that news makes the newspapers, Keeler wonders how it could possibly be true since there is no real Arlette. Next during a rehearsal for Bob's show, LaBelle/Irene dances to a jazzy piano rendition of \"You Are My Lucky Star,\" but, when that doesnt work out well, she taps exquisitely without any accompaniment. A complication arises when the real Arlette wires the World Tribune threatening to sue if they continue writing about her, which causes Keeler to call a meeting with the fake Arlette in his office. By the end of the meeting they have a plan. Bob is throwing a banquet for Arlette that evening. Irene, not Arlette, shows up with Keeler. During the evening's floor show, Frances Langford, in a glittery tux outfit, sings \"Broadway Rhythm.\" Once Miss Langford's solo ends, Ted and Sally dance, then, lots of black or white clad dancers flood the stage. Basil, Bob's assistant, and Lillian ballroom dance until Irene, in silver tails and sequined top hat, enters to tap to a duo piano accompaniment. It turns into a big, impressive number with a flashy ending. As the film ends, Keeler calls his story into the newspaper; the snoring man appears one last time, and Bob and Irene kiss."

While he tends to the injuries, the King's men burst into the room and arrest everyone there as traitors. The trial is quick and unfair. The men are sentenced to death by hanging, but the sentence is commuted when one of the King's advisors recommends selling them as slaves to wealthy landowners in Port Royal, Jamaica. Blood's arrogant attitude offends Port Royal's leading citizen, Colonel Bishop, but it intrigues Bishop's high-spirited niece, Arabella, who bids for him herself. Blood is brutally treated, but Arabella intervenes again and finds him easier work. He forms an escape plan, but on the night set for the escape, Port Royal is fired on by Spanish pirates. In the confusion, the men flee. When Bishop discovers the escape, he vows revenge against Blood. The men have no choice but to become pirates ranging through the Caribbean. During a visit to Tortuga, Blood reluctantly joins forces with the French pirate, Levasseur. The untrustworthy Levasseur boards an English ship, captures two of the passengers and holds them for ransom. They are Lord Willoughby, an emissary of the King, and Arabella, who has been visiting in England, while her uncle, now governor of Jamaica, chases the pirates. To save her from Levasseur, Blood buys her for a handful of pearls. Frustrated, Levasseur demands a fight and is killed in the duel. Misunderstanding everything, Arabella scorns Blood. Stung by her disdain, Blood decides to return her to Port Royal, even though it means his death. In the harbor, they find a battle raging. Willoughby tells the astonished Blood that England and France are at war, and what's more, King James II has been driven from the throne and replaced by King William, who has sent Willoughby to pardon Blood and his men and offer them a commission in the Navy. With one voice, the men vote to fight the French and bravely defeat the fleet. Bishop is removed from his office, Blood is made governor, and Arabella happily agrees to become his wife."

Once there, however, Chan finds out from the professor's daughter Carol, his son Barry, his brother-in-law, Professor Thurston, and Tom Evans, who is Arnold's young assistant and Carol's boyfriend, that Arnold has been missing for a month. When Carol is overcome by worry over her father, Tom sends for Dr. Anton Racine, who arrives shortly after Carol hallucinates that she is being menaced by Sekhmet, the goddess of vengeance whose statue was guarding Ameti's tomb.Meanwhile, in the basement laboratory, Chan, Thurston and Tom examine Ameti's mummy using an X ray. When Chan notices a bullet in the mummy's chest, they unwrap it and discover not Ameti but Professor Arnold. Thurston then tells Chan that he sold the artifacts to pay off money he had borrowed from Racine. Barry overhears them discussing his father's death and collapses in hysterics, certain that the tomb's curse will kill the entire family. Chan decides to investigate the tomb that night, so with Tom and his helper Snowshoes, he sets off, but once inside the tomb, they are frightened off by a vision of Sekhmet.The next day, Chan goes to Luxor to question Daoud Atrash, the chemist who fills Racine's prescriptions for Carol. That night, when Chan returns to the Arnold house, an autopsy of the professor is underway, and after the others leave, Chan extracts the bullet from near Arnold's heart. Chan then rejoins the others upstairs and questions Racine about Mapouchari, a drug which causes hallucinations and death, and which Chan suspects is placed on Carol's cigarettes to trigger her attacks. They are just about to talk to Barry about the secret treasure his father was trying to find when Barry dies while playing his violin.Later, Chan, Tom and Snowshoes return to the tomb, where they find a secret water passageway. Tom swims to the next room, which is a storage room for Ameti's treasures, but he is shot by someone he recognizes. As he falls, he hits a lever that opens a door between the rooms, and Chan and Snowshoes take him back to the house. After the bullet is removed, Chan takes it for evidence, then goes to search Barry's room.Chan deduces that Barry was killed by a tiny vial of the deadly drug. He demonstrates to Thurston and Racine how the violin's vibrations shattered the glass, releasing the drug in gaseous form. He then tells them it was the hidden treasure room which was the motive for the two murders and the attempt on Tom's life. Upstairs, Racine examines Tom, after which Thurston sends Carol to rest. Alone with Tom, Thurston prepares to stab him in his wounds with Racine's lancet, but Chan arrives just in time. Chan explains that the bullets recovered from Arnold and Tom came from Thurston's gun, and the police then take Thurston away. Tom regains consciousness and is enfolded in Carol's loving embrace."

        "summary": "When a prominent official is murdered at a banquet honoring Charle Chan, the detective and son Lee team up to expose an opium-smuggling ring.",
        "sinopsis": "Before Honolulu detective Charlie Chan leaves his boat upon arriving in Shanghai for his first visit in years, supposedly a vacation, a man stuffs a note in his pocket warning him not to leave the ship. At the docks, Chan is greeted by Sir Stanley Woodland's secretary, Philip Nash, and Sir Stanley's niece Diana, before he is surprised by his son Lee, who was sent by his firm to look into the trade situation there.At a banquet that evening in Chan's honor, as Sir Stanley opens a jade box supposedly containing a scroll for Chan, he is shot by a gun set to go off from inside the box. The box had been in Nash's possession all day. Later that night, a man sneaks into Chan's room and, with a silencer on his gun, shoots the figure in Chan's bed and escapes. Chan, fortunately, had slept on a sofa in his son's room and propped pillows to resemble his figure in the bed. The next day, when Chan calls for room service, the switchboard operator telephones Ivan Marloff to inform him that Chan is still alive.Chan next visits Diana and learns that during the previous evening, someone broke into her father's library and searched through his papers. Chan returns to his room where a man identifying himself as the chauffeur of Colonel Watkins, the chief of police, gives him a note instructing Chan to accompany the chauffeur. After Chan leaves, Lee, realizing the ruse, tries to follow his father, but he is subdued by a taxi driver and taken to the house where Chan is being interrogated by Marloff, who is hidden in darkness. Chan and Lee trick the gang into believing that the police have followed Lee, and through Lee's vigorous fisticuffs, manage to escape.Chan then visits James Andrews, a secret agent from Washington, and they discuss Sir Stanley, a secret agent of the British government who was cooperating with the opium committee of the League of Nations and officials in the Chinese government to round up a gang of smugglers who use Shanghai as a clearinghouse. While they talk, Nash, now Andrews' secretary, searches through his belongings. Noticing in a mirror a gun at the door, Chan ducks and avoids being shot. When Nash's fingerprints are found on the gun, he is arrested.In his room, Chan heats the back of a seemingly innocuous letter marked \"important\" from Sir Stanley to Andrews and discovers a message, which states that Sir Stanley has made an important discovery concerning Ivan Marloff. Chan suspects Andrews because Andrews earlier did not seem interested in the letter, but Andrews then arrives and shows Chan that he knows the secret method of communication.Chan and Andrews search the house where Chan was held, and Chan finds a stamp pad in the fireplace. They then go to police headquarters, where Diana arrives to see Nash, and after she slips him a gun, they escape. Chan returns to his room to find that Lee has trailed the taxi driver who earlier abducted him to a waterfront joint called the Versailles Café. Andrews calls Chan and says that he has cracked the case. When Chan arrives at Andrews' room, he sees Andrews beat a confession out of the chauffeur that Marloff is at the Versailles Café. Andrews leaves with Chan for the café, where, meanwhile, Nash asks Marloff to put him on a boat for America. Calling Nash's escape from jail a trick arranged by Chan, Marloff hits Nash and tells his men to drop him overboard once the boat sails.Upstairs, Chan and Andrews follow the taxi driver into a room where the gang waits hidden. After Chan discovers opium packets in a wine bottle, Andrews suggests that Chan go and signal the police to run the boat to the government dock. Chan delays leaving until the police, whom Lee has called, arrive and capture the gang after a shootout. Chan reveals that it was Andrews' valet who attempted to shoot Chan earlier and that Nash's fingerprints were put on the gun with the stamp pad because the gang felt Nash knew too much about Sir Stanley's investigation. Andrews offers to remove the crooks to his government's boats, but Chan pulls a gun on him and accuses him of being the real head of the gang. Nash had discovered through Sir Stanley's correspondence that the real Andrews neither smoked nor drank, yet the man posing as Andrews earlier accepted Chan's offer of scotch and cigarettes. Lee arrives with a wire photo of Andrews, who was killed three weeks earlier in San Francisco. Chan then sends Nash to comfort Diana. Although he was earlier annoyed that his son was always tying up the phone talking to a girl, Chan allows Lee one phone call to a female friend."

He becomes angry when he sees his streetwalker girlfriend Katie Madden trying to pick up a customer. After he throws the man into the street, Katie laments that she does not have £10 for passage to America to start afresh.Gypo later runs into his friend and IRA comrade Frankie McPhillip, a fugitive with a £20 bounty on his head. Frankie, tired of hiding for six months, is on his way home to visit his mother and sister Mary under cover of the foggy night. The slow-witted Gypo decides to turn informer for the £20 reward, enough for passage to America for the both of them. The Black and Tans find Frankie at his house, and Frankie is killed in the ensuing gunfight. The British contemptuously give Gypo his blood money and let him go.Gypo subsequently buys a bottle of whiskey and tells Katie that he obtained money by beating up an American sailor. He goes to Frankie's wake, and acts suspiciously when coins fall out of his pocket. The men there tell him that they do not suspect Gypo of informing, but he then meets with several of his former IRA comrades, who wonder who informed on Frankie. Gypo claims it was a man named Mulligan. Though Gypo is drunk and talking nonsense, the others begin to suspect him but do not have enough evidence as yet. Gypo leaves and gives out £1 notes to a blind man and some bar patrons, but people wonder why he had such a sudden influx of cash. Meanwhile, Mary tells the IRA that the only person Frankie talked to that day was Gypo, and the men decide to hold an inquest into the death.Gypo goes to an upper-class party to look for Katie, but gets drunk and buys rounds of drinks. Gypo is then taken away by his former IRA comrades when they figure out it was he. He is taken to a kangaroo court, where Mulligan is questioned and is accused once again by Gypo. However, the comrades do not believe Gypo, and give him a detailed accounting of where he spent his entire £20 reward. Gypo then confesses to ratting out Frankie.Gypo is locked up, but before he can be killed he escapes through a hole in the ceiling. He runs to Katie's apartment, where he tells her that he informed on Frankie. Katie goes to see the commissioner who presided over the trial, Dan Gallagher, to beg him to leave Gypo alone. The rigid Gallagher says he cannot do anything, and Gypo might turn in the entire organization to the police if he is allowed to live. However, other IRA members, having overheard Katie, go to her apartment and shoot Gypo, much to Katie's horror as she hears the shots. Gypo wanders into a church where Frankie's mother is praying and begs forgiveness as he confesses to her. She does forgive him, telling him that he did not know what he was doing, and the absolved Gypo dies content on the floor of the church after calling out to Frankie with joy."

While the couple is out drinking one night, narcotics peddlers Tony and Nick befriend Burma's group of friends, hoping to create a market for heroin.At his beach house the next weekend, Tony introduces the unsuspecting girls to marijuana and, in a frenzy of giggles, they undress and run into the ocean in their underwear. One of them, Joan Marsh, swims too far out and is drowned. When the girls return to shore, they discover that she is missing. Burma, meanwhile, is so intoxicated that she becomes sexually aggressive with Dick and they spend time on the beach alone.Following the party, headlines announce Joan's death and the community is outraged. Elaine, in order to protect the reputation of her wealthy fiancee, Morgan Stuart, manages to keep Burma's name out of the scandal. Burma's trouble begins, however, when she learns she is pregnant as a result of her intoxicated behavior at Tony's party and she asks Dick to marry her. Desperate for a job, Dick agrees to meet Tony's drug shipment but is killed during a police raid.Burma then threatens to expose Tony, but he convinces her to stay with him until her baby is born. Following the birth, he puts the baby up for adoption and fashions Burma into Blondie, \"queen of the snow peddlers.\" Soon Burma is a heroin addict.Jumping forward a few years later, Burma, hoping to procure some of her sister's wealth and determined to make Elaine \"suffer the torments of hell,\" Burma kidnaps the Stuarts' daughter. When she goes to collect the $50,000 ransom, however, Morgan refuses to pay, saying the baby is Elaine's sister's and was adopted when her mother disappeared three years before. Meanwhile, the husband of one of Burma's customers discovers a ring missing and calls the police on \"Blondie.\"When the police search Tony's apartment, they find dope and the Stuart child. When Burma returns home to face her own child, she gives herself an extra dose of heroin and, opening the door, sees Nick and Tony handcuffed and the police waiting. Burma collapses on the floor as she sees her daughter's face for the last time, and marijuana cigarettes fall about her head."

        "sinopsis": "Sir Karell Borotyn [Holmes Herbert] has been murdered just two weeks before the wedding of daughter Irena [Elizabeth Allan] to fiance Fedor Vincenti [Henry Wadsworth]. Sir Karell's body was found with two marks on his neck and drained of blood. The superstitious villagers suspect vampirism and finger the town vampires Count Mora [Bela Lugosi] and his daughter Luna [Carroll Borland], but Police Inspector Neumann [Lionel Atwill] can't buy that. After months of investigation, however, Sir Karell's death is declared 'cause unknown', Irena goes to live in the house of guardian Baron Otto von Zinden [Jean Hersholt], and the wedding plans continue as before.One morning, Fedor stumbles in with two marks on his neck, complaining that he fell and hit his head outside of the now-deserted Borotyn castle where Mora and his daughter are supposedly living. Irena is attacked one evening by Mora's daughter, and Neumann calls in vampire expert Professor Zellen [Lionel Barrymore]. When Sir Karell's signature is found on a lease signed after his death and when Irena claims to have heard her father's voice, Neumann and Otto dig up Sir Karell's coffin and find it empty. Shortly thereafter, the maid and butler see Mora in the house and the Professor sees Mora and Sir Karell walking together in the garden, so Neumann and Otto go snooping at the castle. There, they find Mora, his daughter and Sir Karell. That night, Mora's daughter again attacks Irena. Determined to find and destroy the vampires, Neumann, Otto, and the Professor go to the castle, but Mora's daughter leads Irena there, too. Fedor follows and almost destroys the plan.The plan: The Professor (actually Chief Inspector of Prague Police) hypnotizes Otto into re-enacting Sir Karell's murder. It turns out that Otto drugged Sir Karell and murdered him because he wanted Irena for himself. Mora, his daughter Luna, and \"Sir Karell\" turn out to be actors from Luna's Bat Woman Theatre, hired by the police to ferret out Otto. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

        "summary": "First mate Fletcher Christian leads a revolt against his sadistic commander, Captain Bligh, in this classic seafaring adventure, based on the real-life 1789 mutiny.",
        "sinopsis": "In Portsmouth Harbour, England, in December of 1787, preparations are made to sail the H.M.S. Bounty to Tahiti, where her crew will collect breadfruit trees and import them as a cheap source of food for slave camps in the West Indies. Before sailing, a press gang headed by Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, strong-arms Thomas Ellison, William Muspratt, Quintal and others into the King's Navy for the two-year voyage. Roger Byam, a descendant of a long line of decorated naval officers, is made a midshipman on the Bounty and is commissioned by Sir Joseph Banks to help him research his Tahitian dictionary. As the ship is about to set sail, Ellison, who does not want to leave his wife and child, is caught trying to break ship. When Christian learns of Ellison's attempted desertion, he reasons with Ellison and gently persuades him to return and serve his country. Soon after boarding his ship, William Bligh, the Bounty's sadistic captain, orders his crew to witness a \"flogging through the fleet,\" a brutal form of punishment in which court-martialed seamen are flogged in view of every ship in the fleet. Although the master-at-arms pronounces the court-martialed seaman dead as he approaches the Bounty , Bligh insists that he proceed with the flogging. Later, Bligh, who respects only one law, the \"law of fear,\" and tolerates no dissent among his crew, upbraids Christian when he complains about the ship's indecent food supply. Once at sea, Byam is severely punished by Bligh after he and another seaman are caught engaging in a minor fistfight, and is ordered to stand perched on top of the masthead during a storm. Christian tries to end Byam's cruel punishment by calling him down, but Bligh immediately sends him back. Later, Bligh keel-hauls a sailor because he asked for water to treat a wound. When Bligh accuses his crew of stealing cheese from the ship, seaman McCoy informs him that he witnessed Maggs, Bligh's clerk, remove the cheese in Portsmouth under his superior's orders. McCoy is soon punished for exposing the captain's scheme. Desperate for food, seaman Thomas Burkitt and others decide to risk their rationed dinner and use it as bait for shark fishing. They succeed in capturing a shark, but when Maggs insists on a share of the catch, a quarrel ensues and Bligh intercedes. Christian accuses Bligh of starving his crew, and Bligh calls Christian a \"mutinous dog.\" Just as Christian is about to strike Bligh, land is spotted on the horizon and the crew makes preparations for landing. Once in Tahiti, Bligh is greeted by island chief Hitihiti, an old friend of the King's Navy who greeted Captain Cook's ship when Bligh was a sailing master on it ten years earlier. Following the polite exchange of salutations, Bligh puts his crew to work harvesting the breadfruit trees. When Bligh denies Christian shore leave, the kind-hearted Hitihiti manages to secure his freedom and then introduces the lieutenant to his granddaughter Maimiti. Christian falls in love with Maimiti, and before he leaves Tahiti, he instructs Byam to tell her that he will come back for her someday. At sea once again, Bligh orders the flogging of four seamen who attempted to desert and insists that the ship's ailing surgeon witness the punishment. The brutality proves too much for the physician, and he collapses and dies. Christian blames Bligh for the doctor's death and decides to put an end to Bligh's ruthless tyranny by leading the crew in a mutiny. Christian takes over control of the ship by forcing Bligh and his allies into the ship's launch and casting them out to sea. He then turns the ship around and sails it back to Tahiti, where he marries Maimiti. Christian then abandons Byam and other seamen who were loyal to Bligh and were not loaded onto the ship's launch with the captain. As Christian leaves Tahiti to sail the Bounty to a new island, another British ship, the Pandora , is seen approaching on the horizon. The Pandora lands in Tahiti carrying the rescued Bligh, who quickly arrests Byam and the others for mutiny, despite their sworn loyalty to him. Determined to find Christian and see him \"hanging from a yardarm,\" Bligh navigates the Pandora into heavy seas and breaks the ship on a reef. Bligh, Byam and other survivors are rescued and then taken to England. Meanwhile, Christian sails the Bounty to Pitcairn Island, where he sets the ship ablaze and settles his men to begin life anew. Five years pass and Byam, who has been convicted of high treason, receives a pardon when the King learns of Bligh's cruel disciplinary practices. Byam is soon restored to the Royal Navy, and is assigned to its flagship, which is set to fight the French in the battle of Trafalgar and \"sweep the seas for England.\""

        "sinopsis": "In Milan, wealthy dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) has hired sly, wisecracking business manager Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) to help her enter society, but he merely helps himself to her money. At dinner in a fancy restaurant, he introduces her to opera impresario Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Gottlieb tries to persuade her to hire famed Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) for his New York opera company, and takes her to watch an opera performance with Lassparri as lead. Claypool is impressed and agrees to hire Lasspari for $1000 a night. Determined to cut himself a piece of the pie, Driftwood decides to sign Lassparri for the New York opera company first, and rushes backstage after the opera to find him.Backstage, Lassparri is a total jerk who beats his playful, mute assistant Tomasso (Harpo Marx). He tries to romance beautiful chorus member Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle). However, she has two problems with that - first, Lassparri is an arrogant, rude, egotistical brute, and second, she's in love with Riccardo Baroni (Allan Jones). Riccardo sings in the chorus, hoping for his break to stardom. Riccardo meets up with his old friend Fiorello (Chico Marx), Tomasso's partner, who declares himself Riccardo's manager and decides to help him move further in the opera world. Looking to sign Lassparri before Gottlieb gets to him, Driftwood wanders backstage and runs into Fiorello, who claims to be the manager of the greatest tenor in the world. Excited, Driftwood whips out 2 questionable contracts for him and Fiorello to sign; however, due to Fiorello's stupidity and illiteracy and Driftwood's sarcasm, a comical scene unfolds where they argue incessantly about clauses stating things like \"in this contract, the party of the first part shall be known as the party of the first part\" and so on. They end up ripping both contracts to shreds, though they both agree they have a contract. At this point, Gottlieb and Claypool arrive backstage and find Lassparri and sign him up - Fiorello informs a confused Driftwood that HE signed Riccardo Baroni!Gottlieb prepares to set sail for New York at once with Mrs. Claypool, Driftwood, and Lassparri. Also joining the group is Rosa, at Lassparri's request to have her as a leading lady; sadly, this means leaving Riccardo behind. As everyone boards the boat, Lassparri is begged by the paparazzi to sing for the crowd, but he feigns laryngitis: \"Why should I sing if I'm not being paid for it?\" Instead, Rosa sings \"Alone\", a popular love song. Riccardo, on the dock, joins in. While he is singing, Rosa asks Gottlieb to consider bringing Riccardo along. He tells her that Riccardo has a nice voice, but will have to wait until he has developed a reputation.On the boat, Driftwood finds Rosa crying and delivers to her a love letter from Riccardo to cheer her up. As the smartass conman rides luggage carts to his room, he finds that Gottlieb's set him up in a room no bigger than a storage closet, in which his suitcase takes up half the room. An angry Driftwood opens his luggage to find his clothes gone, and that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo have stowed away inside: after all, Driftwood DID sign Riccardo to the company. Not wanting to get caught with the illegal stowaways, Driftwood demands the 3 leave: Fiorello will only leave after they've been fed. Driftwood then orders multiple plates of food (with multiple hard-boiled eggs) to the room.What begins now is the \"stateroom scene\", one of the most famous comedy scenes of all time. Already crowded in the closet-sized room are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Riccardo, and the giant suitcase. Slowly, more people begin crowding in the room: two maids come in to make the bed, the engineer and his large assistant come in to fix the heat, and a manicurist shows up to do Driftwood's nails. The already too-small room becomes too crowded as all this action takes place at the same time, and Driftwood continues to let more people in: a cleaning woman comes in to clean up, a young woman looking for her Aunt Minnie tries to use the phone, and finally, the servers with all the food. All these people try to fit in the room with their separate duties as a smirking Driftwood remarks, \"Say, is it my imagination or is it getting crowded in here?\" Finally, Mrs. Claypool comes by and opens the door, and all 15 people come crashing out of the room into the hallway.That night, there are festivities going up on the ship's main deck, including a big dinner where Lassparri tries hitting on Rosa, who rejects him yet again, and a dance. An honor is given to three famous aviators with large beards, who are traveling to New York City for a large ceremony. Mrs. Claypool tells Driftwood she doesn't want him associating with Fiorello and Tomasso, as they are riff-raff, far below her social class. Meanwhile, bored inside their stateroom, Fiorello, Tomasso and Riccardo sneak up to the main deck and help themselves to dinner. Afterwards, Fiorello starts to play the piano and Tomasso plays the harp, much to the enjoyment of the children on board. However, Lassparri spots the three stowaways and informs the crew: they chase the stowaways and throw them into the detention cabin.Locked up in the brig the next day, Tomasso plays the harmonica much to Fiorello's annoyance, who throws the harmonica out the window into the ocean. Tomasso jumps out the window and into the ocean to get his harmonica. Driftwood, spotting Tomasso from an open window, tosses him the rope to the anchor. Tomasso grabs on to the rope and is lifted back up on to the ship, landing in the stateroom of the three bearded aviators, who lay in bed asleep. Seeing as how the stowaways are illegally entering the country, Tomasso gets an idea to get them safely into New York City, takes out a pair of scissors, and goes to work...The boat docks in New York City. When the paparazzi try to get the 3 aviators from their room, Driftwood impersonates as their manager, and takes the bearded \"aviators\" - Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo wearing the shaved-beards as disguises- off the boat. The 3 real aviators are left tied up and gagged to their bed. The \"aviators\" and Driftwood are taken to a large ceremony at City Hall, where thousands upon thousands of people stand audience in the city, watching. The Mayor presents the 3 aviators with awards and asks them to talk about their accomplishments. Fiorello gives a fake, messed up speech to the crowds, while Tomasso drinks multiple glasses of water to stall time, leading Police Sgt. Henderson (Robert Emmett O'Connor) to suspect that the trio are impostors. The trio pretend to be offended by the sergeant's accusations and storm off, leading him to apologize to the Mayor and Tomasso. Tomasso hugs him- but when he does, his fake beard comes off, exposing their ruse. Everyone goes mad trying to catch the illegal frauds as they escape.Word is out all over New York City and on the front page of the next day's newspapers as police look for Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo. Driftwood, hiding the trio in his hotel room as to avoid arrest and deportation, shows the news to them and demands they leave before he gets arrested. Before they can, Sgt. Henderson comes knocking at the door to investigate Driftwood's room. As Driftwood tries to slyly deal with Henderson and make him leave, Fiorello Tomasso and Riccardo hide on the fire escape between the kitchen area and the bedroom. As Henderson moves back and forth between the two rooms, the three stowaways use the fire escape to move furniture from the bedroom into the kitchen, leading Henderson to believe he's losing his mind and gone crazy until Driftwood finally gets him to leave.The day of the big opera finally arrives: Il Trovatore starring Lassparri and Rosa. As Rosa prepares in her room, Riccardo visits and they reunite. However, Lassparri enters and becomes disappointed when he sees the two together, and angry when Riccardo kicks him out of the room. Meanwhile, Driftwood arrives at the theater and gets a happy reception from the chorus: only for Gottlieb to tell Driftwood that Mrs. Claypool has officially dispensed with his services for associating with the riffraff (Fiorello and Tomasso), and he is fired. Driftwood is kicked down the staircase and thrown out of the theater, now unemployed.Out of a job, out of money, and kicked out of his hotel, Driftwood is left with nothing else but a bench in Central Park, with Fiorello, Tomasso, and Riccardo still with him. Incredibly resentful of how his life is pretty much ruined, he wishes he never met any of them and to be back in Milan. Rosa shows up heartbroken and in tears: she informs the group that, because she doesn't love Lassparri, Lassparri persuaded Gottlieb to fire her from the opera, and she has been replaced with another diva. Fed up with how far Gottlieb and Lassparri have gone, Driftwood decides enough is enough: he begins to plot revenge, the way only the Marx Brothers can...That night, crowds have filled the big theater to see the opera. Gottlieb arrives in a fancy suit and enters his office: only to find Driftwood, Tomasso, and Fiorello smoking his cigars and eating his dinner. As he tries to call the police, the three of them knock him out and strip him of his clothes, which Driftwood puts on. Their plan has begun: destroy the opera. Driftwood takes Gottlieb's spot in the box seat next to Mrs. Claypool, and delivers a smart-mouthed speech to the audience as the orchestra gets ready. However, sitting in the orchestra causing trouble are Fiorello and Tomasso, who distract the maestro by tapping on instruments. Gottlieb, having woken up and put on Driftwood's too-small clothes, gets to the orchestra box to catch Driftwood, he jumps out and runs for it. Gottlieb sends his men after him and calls the police.What happens next is 7 minutes of the most amazing operatic mayhem ever to visit the movie screen.Fiorello and Tomasso have inserted \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" into the musicians' sheet music. When they reach that point and start playing it, the two begin playing baseball in the orchestra, as Driftwood walks around the audience selling peanuts. Gottlieb chases Fiorello and Tomasso into the storage area under the stage, where they knock him out yet again. Driftwood remains running around the opera house, making snarky comments towards everything as Gottlieb's men chase him.The curtain rises and the opera begins... with Fiorello and Tomasso in costume on the stage with the chorus. They begin to run amok, ripping off singers' clothing and generally causing havoc in the scene. Sgt. Henderson and his police guards arrive backstage, ready to catch and arrest Driftwood and his illegal friends. They find Gottlieb and wake him up, and inform him that the 3 are still out there, sabotaging the opera. Dressing up in costume, the 2 men sneak on to the stage in the middle of the scene to catch Tomasso. However, he escapes by climbing up the backdrop of the stage and disappearing into the rafters of the opera house. He then begins swinging, Tarzan-style, on the ropes and pulleys backstage. This causes various inappropriate backdrops--vendor pushcarts, trolleybuses, and a battleship--to move up and down on the stage while Lassparri is singing. In one case a backdrop is actually in front of Lassparri. Tomasso then swings directly over the stage, making a daring flying snatch of Lassparri's wig.The police are chasing him all over the backstage area, also swinging on ropes. When Tomasso is cornered, he jumps directly down a backdrop, tearing it in two. The police corner him on the ground, and he runs/climbs back UP the backdrop, then swings on a rope over to the electrical control panel.He turns off all the lights. Lassparri, still singing solo despite the chaos, suddenly starts to scream but is silenced. When the power is restored, Lassparri is missing! While it was dark, Fiorello and Driftwood have kidnapped, bound, and gagged him, and put him in a box hanging up in the rafters. The box is held up by the ropes controlled by Tomasso. The 4 are completely out of sight of anyone below.Gottlieb is in a panic. He needs a tenor for the next song. Suddenly, Riccardo and Rosa walk in. Gottlieb begs Riccardo to sing lead in the opera. Riccardo points out that he \"has no reputation,\" (as Gottlieb had pointed out at the start of the voyage.) He demands that his counterpart in the duet be Rosa, since they have practiced it. Gottlieb has no choice but to put both of them in costume and send them out on stage.Riccardo and Rosa put on an amazing performance of the sad duet \"Miserere\". In contrast to the preceding raucous goings-on, the audience now pays rapt and appreciative attention to the new singers. Even Gottlieb is impressed. (Ms. Carlisle and Mr. Jones were classically trained; they did their own singing.) At the end of the song, there is thunderous applause. After Riccardo and Rosa go off stage, Lassparri is released. He angrily demands to go out on stage, saying \"I'll sing them an encore that they will never forget.\" But the audience will have nothing of this. They boo him off the stage. He storms out of the opera house.Gottlieb's course of action is clear. Riccardo and Rosa will be the new stars of the opera company. After quickly consenting to a few demands--all criminal charges will be dropped, and Driftwood will get his job back--he sends the two back on stage for an encore before the enthusiastic audience. All ends happily, or will end happily as soon as Driftwood, Fiorello, and Gottlieb can agree on a contract. Which requires agreement about the role of the \"party of the tenth part.\""

Bertram Grant  in the credits but actually played Geoffrey.The character of Dr. Jerry Holden is listed in the credits and captions as Jerry Halden.They are listed below in their correct associations.**Dancer Jean Thatcher (Irene Ware) is driving fast in a rainstorm. Losing control, she crashes and is brought to a nearby hospital. After examination by several doctors who say they cant do anything for her, Jeans fiancé Dr. Jerry Holden (Lester Matthews) suggests Dr. Richard Vollin (Bela Lugosi), formerly associated with the hospital but now a recluse doing only research.Meanwhile, Dr. Vollin is heard reciting Edgar Allan Poes  The Raven  to museum curator Chapman (Arthur Hoyt) who tries to buy Vollins collection of Poe memorabilia. He is told about his torture devices but is rushed out by Vollin.A phone call to Vollin is made, who refuses to help, citing that the other doctors are competent. Her father, Judge Thatcher (Samuel S. Hinds) takes the phone and begs Vollin to save his daughters life. He refuses and hangs up. Finding out where the doctor lives, he goes to Vollins home and continues begging in person. Vollin appears to have no compassion or sympathy for her and refuses. Thatcher appeals to him as a doctor who has taken an oath, to which Vollin replies, I make no such oath. I am a law unto myself. Death hasnt the same significance for me as it has for you, Vollin concludes. Insisting that Vollin save her life, Thatcher is told by Vollin that the other doctors are competent. It is only when told that everyone says that Dr. Vollin is the only one who can save her that he rises, puffed up, saying, So, they DO say that I'm the only one? Very well, I will go.The operation proceeds, with Vollin being shown as having an unusual interest in the patients beauty.One month later, Jean is being entertained by Vollin in his home. Having listened to him play Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D Minor  on organ, she gushes that Vollin is not only a brilliant surgeon but a great musician. She intimates that maybe he is more than an extraordinary man, to which he eagerly answers a god? With the taint of human emotions. She tells him she wishes she could repay him for saving her life. Clutching her and staring into her eyes he tells her the restraint we put upon ourselves can drive us mad. Uncomfortable, she makes an excuse to leave, reminding him of her performance the following night. Nothing can keep me away, he promises. She tells him she will have a surprise for him that night and leaves.The next evening a show marquee sign tells of her performance in a dance interpretation of Poes  The Raven . She dances while a man dressed as Poe (Raine Bennett) recites the poem. In one of the balcony box seats, Thatcher observes Vollin madly obsessing over his daughters performance.Afterwards backstage, Jerry reassures Jean that the audience liked her performance, saying that twelve encores was enough. Entering the dressing room to congratulate her include Pinkey (Ian Wolfe) and Mary Burns (Inez Courtney), her father and Dr. Vollin, who kisses her hand, gushing about her surprise Poe interpretation. Again, Thatcher observes Vollin taking more than a casual interest in Jean.The next day Thatcher arrives at Vollins to tell him to leave Jean alone. She is in danger of becoming infatuated with you. We cant let her get any ideas about you, can we?  the judge intones, She is engaged to young Jerry Holden, he tells Vollin. Speaking of his interest in Jean, Vollin crushes a test tube in his hand. This convinces Thatcher that Vollin is seriously involved in a similar infatuation. Told to leave her alone, Vollin insists that the judge bring his daughter to him. I find you stark staring mad, Thatcher tells him and leaves.Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff), an escaped convict trying to disguise himself is given the address of Dr. Vollin in a local tavern. He arrives that evening and is invited into Vollins office. When Vollin addresses him by name, Bateman wants to know who told him. It is explained that Batemans violent prison break and photo were in the newspapers. Vollin seems very interested that Batemans bank robbery and mutilation of a bank cashier's face with an acetylene torch was especially torturous. Come to ask Vollin to change his face so he will not be recognized, Bateman is promised help but only if he agrees to commit murder and torture. Desperate, he agrees and is told the alteration will be done now. Bateman is led into a room and made to lie on a table for surgery.Later, a bandaged Bateman is checked on by the doctor. When the patient awakens, Vollin raises him up vertically and begins slowly removing the bandages. As his face is revealed, half of it is shown to be horribly disfigured and one eye dislocated. Bateman speaks in a raspy voice, asking if he looks different. Yes, Vollin replies with noted glee. Feeling something is not right with his face, Bateman feels with his fingers and demands to see his reflection. Dr. Vollin agrees and leaves the room, telling him to wait. As Bateman gets up and looks around, several curtains are opened, revealing a series of large mirrors, each one reflecting the ugliness of Bateman one by one. Horrified, he begins shooting, breaking each mirror. From a grate near the ceiling, Vollin appears, laughing hysterically at Batemans misery. Having run out of bullets, Bateman frustratingly throws the gun at Vollin's face.Moments later Vollin asks Bateman if he is ready to do the murder job, telling him he must answer yes or no. Bateman insists that his face be fixed but Vollin says he must do this job for him first. He agrees. Vollin returns to the room a moment later, giving Bateman some clothes to put on and then report for further instructions.Having invited Jean, Jerry, Pinkey, Mary and Col. Bertram Grant (Spencer Charters) and his wife Harriet (Maidel Turner) to a party, they make bets on a horserace game which is mechanically run in Dr. Vollins home. At one point Jean announces she will have to go upstairs to fix her hair and does so, which is noted by Vollin and Bateman, who now serves as the butler. Meanwhile, Judge Thatcher arrives home to find Vollins written invitation to the party, to which also a note added that Jean and Jerry decided to go and for her father to join them.When Thatcher arrives, Vollin immediately apologizes for what he said the other day, asking him to forgive him. The judge seems reluctant but is quickly reassured by Vollin, who joyfully leads him into the party. Bateman is told to go upstairs and tell Jean her father has arrived. When he opens the door and Jean sees Bateman in the mirror behind her, she screams and runs downstairs into her fathers arms. Everyone crowds around as she tells of this awful man who came into her room. Vollin interrupts and tells everyone to come and sit while he tells the story of his servants unfortunate disfigurement. His guests are told with some relish how he served with Vollin in his regiment and was tortured by the enemy, who mutilated his face. Describing his interest in death and torture, he makes a reference to Poe. Jean asks what is Vollins interpretation of  The Raven  and is told that Poe was a great genius who was denied his love, Lenore. Getting tired, it is suggested that they all retire to their rooms for the night and they begin going upstairs. When Jean passes Bateman, she apologizes, saying she was suddenly surprised and would not have screamed if she had known. Bateman sees this sympathetic gesture and acts as if he wants to tell his secret. Vollin notices Bateman talking to Jean and is concerned.Outside a windy thunderstorm is beating down trees.Upstairs, Judge Thatcher is shown to his room by Vollin, who is called over by Col. Grant and asked about drafts in the house. Assured they will be comfortable, the Colonel and his wife go upstairs to the third floor where their room is. Thatcher comes into Jeans room with Jerry and begins ranting again about Vollin being mad and dangerous. He tells the couple to come home with him now. His fears are laughed at by Jerry, who says Vollin is just being amusing and is too reputable and distinguished a surgeon to be considered dangerous. Against his better judgment Thatcher resigns himself to stay the night, but not before Jerry announces that he will switch rooms with Jean for her protection.Knocking on the door and entering, Bateman comes in to try to tell Judge Thatcher what is going on. Vollins voice is heard calling Bateman. Coming to the door, he chastises Bateman into going downstairs. Trying to reassure his guests, Vollin apologizes and says his servant probably just wanted to see if he could help them. Jean says they are now comfortable and Vollin bids them goodnight.Going down into a dungeon below, Vollin shows Bateman his instruments of torture, telling him many are described by Poe in his writings. He says they are very old but warns ready for use.\nHe shows Bateman a slab with manacles for feet and arms to hold a man still for the Pit and Pendulum device. Getting up on the slab to demonstrate, Vollin shows how a man may be held captive by throwing a lever. Bateman quickly throws the lever, which traps Vollin. Gotcha! Bateman says grimly. As the pendulum swings slowly back and forth over him, Vollin tells Bateman to release him, reminding him that should anything happen to me, you remain the horrible monster you are. Bateman reluctantly releases him. Vollin tells him the blade descends upon the victim in fifteen minutes time which can be seen on a clock built into the stone wall.Later Bateman comes up through a trap door into Jeans room, but suddenly the wind causes a tree to crash through the window, awakening Jean. Looking around, she sees Bateman, who retreats and closes the trap door. She screams and runs to Jerrys room, telling him she is frightened. They go into her room and Jerry tells her its only a tree which the storm blew into the window. She says she saw a man coming up through the floor, which he amusingly thinks is her imagination. He tells her to sleep in his room, and he will stay in hers.In Vollins office, he tells Bateman at gunpoint to leave the girl alone and strikes him with a small whip. Just then a knock at the door interrupts them. The Colonel wants a sleeping powder for his wife. Dr. Vollin comes back with two powders, telling him there is one for each of them. Vollin tells Bateman that now the job will begin.Sneaking into Thatchers room, Bateman strong-arms him out of bed and downstairs to the torture chamber. Along the way Thatchers cries are heard by Jerry, who attempts to locate him. They enter Vollins study through the bookcase panel entrance into a passageway down below. Bateman punches Jerry and prevents him from entering, closing the door. Below, Thatcher is brought before a waiting Vollin, who apologizes to the judge for the savagery of his servant. Bateman is told to put Thatcher on the slab. The blade is turned on and Thatcher asks about it. Vollin tells him it will reach him in fifteen minutes. He explains that he is the sanest man of all because he removes torture from his life by torturing others. Judge Thatcher nervously watches the swinging pendulum as Vollin laughs maniacally. Meanwhile, Jerry comes to and tries to find how to open the bookcase entrance.Vollin goes to a master control and throws a switch which lowers Jeans bedroom down to the dungeon. He watches Jean screaming as the large elevator reaches the bottom where he is laughing at her. Closing the door, he seems amused by her cries. Unable to open the panel, Jerry runs upstairs to Jeans room and opens the door as he hears her cries. Holding onto the doorknob, he swings in midair where the room has been lowered. He is barely able to recover and go out the door again. He calls for the others to help him and they follow. He explains that Jean and her father have been taken and to wake the Grants. A few minutes later Jerry is told that the Grants seem to have been drugged and cannot be awakened. They try to find the opening to the bookcase panel. Jerry picks up the phone to call, but this is anticipated by Vollin, who switches off the phones from his control. At the same time another switch lowers steel shutters on all the windows, sealing them in.Vollin tells Bateman to quiet the girl. As he goes to do this, Vollin tells Thatcher that he has  a most delightful plan for her. Bateman opens the door and tells Jean he said to stop. She stares at his face. He tells her he knows he is ugly and that Vollin did it. Saying Vollin is mad, she asks Bateman to help her get out. He says no, because the doctor will fix his face. She tells Bateman that Vollin wont help him but that she will. He is called back by Vollin and told to attend to Thatcher.Vollin now opens the bookcase door and Jerry says he will go in. The others follow. Finding a passageway leading downstairs to the dungeon, Jerry sees Bateman standing by Thatcher and a fight ensues. Vollin holds a gun on Jean. Jerry runs to where Jean is standing with Vollin. Bateman approaches and holds Jerry. Meanwhile, Thatcher tells the others to release him from the slab. When told the lever is locked, Thatcher tells them the servant must have the key. They rush in and see Jean and Jerry held at gunpoint by Vollin. He tells them they are in time for a wedding. He tells Bateman to open the room door, and then tells Jean and Jerry to go in. The switch is thrown to close the steel door. They are told they will remain in this room forever and that their love will make it beautiful. Bateman comes over and asks Vollin what happens in that room. He is told that it is another of Poes stories: the room where the walls come together. Dr. Vollin now loudly proclaims that his torture is complete and that Poe is avenged. Bateman asks if they will be crushed. Vollin says yes, telling Bateman that he will fix his face now. Again Bateman asks if the girl will be crushed to death and is told yes. He tells Vollin no and goes to throw the switch. Vollin threatens him and when the switch is thrown Bateman is shot and staggers. Getting the key, Pinkey goes and frees Thatcher.There is a struggle between Bateman and Vollin, who is knocked out and dragged into the room by Bateman as the couple emerges. Bateman rushes to close the door. Vollin cries out to Bateman as the door closes and the walls close in to crush him. When Bateman and Vollin are dead, Mary screams and says we forgot the Grants! They are shown snoring in their beds.Jean and Jerry are seen driving home and she says she was almost crushed. He jokes that he will finish the process, only softer. She tells him that he is now the big bad raven."

Upon seeing the furious Dale, Jerry falls instantly in love and, in spite of her snubbing, daily sends flowers to her room. Then, while posing as a hansom cab driver, Jerry delivers Dale to her riding lesson in the park and romances her in a pavilion during a rain storm. Dale's loving bliss is shattered, however, when she incorrectly deduces that Jerry, whose name she has never heard, is actually the husband of her matchmaking friend, Madge Hardwick. In spite of her desire to return to America, Dale is convinced by Alberto Beddini, her adoring, ambitious Italian dressmaker, to accept Madge's invitation to join her in Italy. Before leaving, Dale encounters Jerry in the hotel and slaps him without explanation. Worried that the slap will cause a scandal, the hotel management admonishes a confused Horace, who in turn blames the incident on Bates, his quarrelsome valet. After Horace orders Bates to follow Dale, he receives a telegram from Madge saying that Dale is on her way to the Lido in Venice. Overjoyed, Jerry rushes through his London revue and flies to Venice with Horace, unaware that Dale has confessed to Madge in their hotel room that her husband has made illicit advances toward her. In Italy, Jerry continues to be baffled by Dale's emotional vacilations, while Horace is equally baffled by Alberto's threats of bodily violence. At the hotel nightclub, Dale dances with Jerry at the urging of Madge, who is unaware that Dale has mistaken Jerry, the man that she is trying to get Dale to marry, for Horace. When Jerry then proposes to Dale, she slaps him again, while Madge, who had taken Dale's initial revelations about Horace with good humor, punches her husband in the eye. Depressed and heartsick, Dale succumbs to the affections of Alberto and accepts his marriage proposal. The next day, Jerry learns that Dale has married and, by tap dancing as he did in London, connives to see her alone. Although Dale finally learns Jerry's true identity while cruising with him in a gondola, the revenge-hungry Alberto pursues the couple across the canals. Eventually Bates reveals that, while following Dale and Alberto, he had impersonated a clergyman and performed their marriage ceremony. Legally single, Dale now accepts Jerry's proposal and, back in the nightclub, dances happily with him across the floor."

The daughter goes to a mountain village where father is gold panning and living with an ex-geisha with whom he has had two children. Ex-geisha turns out not to be, as suspected, a gold-digger and husband stealer but instead is a pleasant woman, who feels guilty about the first family (she's been sending the money orders without the father's knowledge) and is a good match for the down to earth father. Daughter has second thoughts about breaking up this happy arrangement but the ex-geisha supports the visit and, once in Tokyo, the daughter goes back to her plan of bringing her parents back together again. However, the husband goes to sleep during the Noh play his wife likes while she criticises his liking for sake. The crunch comes when she puts working on poetry before talking to her husband. Despite her own feelings and her brother's incredulity, the over-intellectual wife drives her fairly incompatible husband away for a second time and he returns to his second family in the mountains."

        "sinopsis": "This is the second installment of the Thin Man series, the story picks up from where \"The Thin Man\" left Nick and Nora.Arriving home after three days on the train, Nick and Nora were looking forward to spending a quiet new year with just each other. But their house was occupied by drunken friends; and Nora's most uppity relative, the spinster Aunt Katherine, called and insisted that Nora and Nick join her New Year's Eve family dinner. Nora did not care for her aunt but she agreed to go, mainly to visit her distraught cousin Selma Landis.Aunt Katherine had not changed her mind about the flatfoot to whom poor Nora was married, but she needed Nick to discreetly investigate the disappearance of Selma's playboy husband Robert. Selma's mental condition was beginning to deteriorate and Aunt Katherine was worried that even with the close supervision of psychiatrist Dr. Kammer, the scandal will break out and ruin the Forrest reputation.After dinner, Nick and Nora went to say goodbye to Selma before leaving, and met David Graham. David used to be engaged to Selma and was still in love with her. Furious about the way Robert treated Selma, David told Nick that Robert wasn't really missing, he just had enough of Selma and wanted a divorce. He even promised David that if he pays him $25,000, he will divorce Selma and get out of the way.Nick and Nora decided to spend New Year s Eve in a seedy but popular Chinese club called Lichee, managed by ex-con Dancer, once arrested and sent away by Nick, and Lum Kee, whose brother was also arrested by Nick and was still in jail.They found Robert at the club. He had become a regular at Lichee because of the starring singer/dance girl Polly Byrnes, and was planning to run away with her once he gets the money from David. Polly was not in love with Robert, and kept things up with Robert just so that she and boyfriend Dancer could scam money from him. Running into Nick and Nora made Robert, Polly and Dancer uneasy, and Robert decided to not wait for cash and told David that he will take anything and leave town that night.David met Robert secretly and gave him a stack of bonds, and a happy Robert went home to pack up. He woke Selma in the process, the two had a fight, Robert said his final word and stormed out. Selma lost her nerve and ran out after him.David was worried about a confrontation between Selma and Robert and he went back to the Forrest mansion to check on Selma, only to find her standing over Robert's dead body with a gun in her hand. David took the gun and disposed of it for Selma, told her not to mention the incident to anyone.A hungry Nora woke Nick up so that he can make her some scrabbled eggs, and while they were in the kitchen, someone threw in a stone with a note attached to it. Asta, who's being irritable lately because he found out that one of Mrs. Asta's puppies was definitely not his, but that of a black Scottish terrier, got to the stone before Nick and Nora. A chase broke out and when Nora finally got the note, the most important part of the note was already eaten by Asta.Nick and Nora went back to bed and slept till early evening the next day. When Lieutenant Abrams dropped by to tell Nick to that they've ran out of leads, Nick decided to follow the clues from the note and visit Polly's ex-con husband Ralph West, now known as her brother Phil.Nick and Abrams found Phil murdered with the same gun that killed Robert, other evidence was planted and took them no where; except a key to Polly's apartment. Having lost all other leads, Nick decided to check out this one.In Polly's apartment, Nick noticed a hole on the ceiling and went to check the apartment directly above hers. The tenant's name was Anderson, a fake name; and in the apartment, Nick found contraptions that allowed a person to listen in and a makeshift ladder to climb down and enter her apartment through the window.As Nick was testing the earphone, Dancer came back to Polly's apartment, he sensed that someone was upstairs and made a run for it. Nick pursued him and was shot at. The shots missed him, but they did shoot open a box, from which the dead body of the apartment janitor Pedro fell out.Nick now knew exactly what happened but didn't have any strong evidence, he and Abrams decided to test their luck and gathered everyone in Polly's apartment, to see if they can trick the murderer into making a mistake.So arrived the suspects: Dancer, Polly, Lum Kee, Aunt Katherine, Dr. Kammer, David, and the grieving widow Selma.It turned out that Robert was not killed over money, but from a deep hatred; the death of Phil and Pedro were just the results of the murderer, the mysterious Anderson, trying to cover his tracks.Anderson found out everything by listening in to Polly's conversations with Dancer, Robert and Phil. He would have climbed into her apartment to plant incriminating evidence had he not been locked out by Pedro. Pedro found out about the special contraptions while doing repair works, changed the lock on the door and called Nick. Anderson heard the phone call and killed Pedro.Anderson then followed Robert until he stepped out of the Forrest mansion and killed him. Knowing that Phil was following Polly and Robert, Anderson killed him too.Crowded and pressured by the cool Nick, jumpy Abrams, and irritating Aunt Katherine, Anderson remained calm. But when it was revealed that the janitor Pedro was once Nora's father's gardener, Nick caught him. All suspects who knew Pedro merely stated that they knew him, only David added a description of him, a description that would describe Pedro the Janitor, not the younger Pedro the gardener.David pulled out a gun and was about to kill both Selma and himself when unexpectedly, Lum Kee came to everyone's rescue. Nora had been wary of Lum Kee the whole time, thinking that he might harm Nick. But It turned out that as Nick sent his brother away, Lum Kee got the chance to go after his brother's girlfriend, whom he likes a lot more than his own brother.Unable to find peace in San Francisco as well, Nick took Nora and Asta on the train again. Noticing that his wife was not paying attention to him, Nick put down his cocktail glass just long enough to get a closer look at what Nora was knitting. It was a baby shoe."

        "sinopsis": "The film's plot involves three submarine mates, Ted Barker (James Stewart), Gunny Saks (Sid Silvers), and Mush Tracy (Buddy Ebsen), arriving in New York City after four years at sea. The film opens as their sub reaches New York harbor with the sailors singing \"Rolling Home.\" Featured in the number are Gunny, Mush, Ted and a quartet called The Foursome.\nAs many of the sailors receive liberty, Gunny and Mush were denied shore leave until their Captain sends them to deliver a letter to Rear Admiral Stubbins. Nora Paige (Eleanor Powell), a singer and dancer, who has just lost out on a Broadway show, enters the Lonely Hearts Club suitcase in hand. The club's receptionist, Jenny (Una Merkel), offers to share her apartment with Nora. When she introduces Nora to the others at the club, Nora demonstrates her talents by singing and dancing to \"Rap Tap on Wood\" (Miss Powell's vocals are dubbed by Marjorie Lane). Also featured was The Foursome, a quartet of harmony singers, who also play a penny whistle and different sizes of ocarinas (also known as sweet potatoes).\nJenny tells Nora about her marriage to a sailor who was her partner in a twenty-eight day marathon dance. They conceived a daughter, Sally, in the two days they had together before he shipped out and she never told the guy he was a father. That guy was Gunny, who is anxious to rekindle a relationship with his wife. Meanwhile, Mush falls for a talented singer/waitress, Peppy Turner (Frances Langford).\nRomance enters Nora's life in the form of Ted Barker. At their first meeting at the Lonely Hearts Club, Ted sings \"Hey, Babe, Hey\" to Nora as they dance. Then several other members of the cast sing a chorus including Nora, Gunny, Jenny, Peppy, Mush and the Foursome. The number ends with the sailors and their girl friends tap dancing. Later, Captain Percival Dingby (Raymond Walburn) announces Lucy James (Virginia Bruce), a famous actress, is coming aboard the sub. The men sing about her arrival. Once she comes aboard with her cute little dog under her arm, Miss James sings \"Love Me, Love My Pekinese.\" During a photo session with the Captain, he drops her dog overboard; all the sailors dive in to rescue the pup. The next days newspaper features a photo of Ted handing the soaked dog to Miss James. McKay, her agent, immediately plots to cook up a romance between Ted and Lucy to generate publicity for her new show.\nThe next scene is one of the most, if not the most, famous musical sequence from the film. Ted begins crooning \"Easy to Love\" to Nora as they stroll in Central Park. After they kiss, Nora sings; they kiss again and she dances while Ted conducts an imaginary orchestra. A Central Park policeman (Reginald Gardiner) takes over the symphony maestro role as he directs the imaginary orchestra in a combination of Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\" and \"Easy to Love.\" By the end of the number, the policeman/conductor keels over in a dead faint.\nLucy and McKay arranged with Captain Dingby for Ted to have dinner with Lucy at the Club Continental. The evening's entertainment was Georges and Jalanas (Georges and Jalana appeared as themselves) ballroom dancing to \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\" Ted had told Nora he would meet her later in Central Park, but, after waiting far past the appointed time, Nora dejectedly leaves.\nThe next morning's newspaper features a photo of Ted and Lucy together, which, of course, disturbs Nora. When Ted calls to apologize, she hangs up on him. Ted goes to McKay's office to bargain with him to give Nora a job in Lucy's new production, but he doesn't want Nora to know about their arrangement. McKay makes her Lucy's understudy.\nJenny, Sally, and Nora visit the sub, but Jenny still isn't sure she wants Gunny to know he has a daughter, so Nora claims Sally as her child. Ted assumes Nora is married and backs off.\nLucy begins to care for Ted and refuses to allow any further publicity about their relationship. She says if any more articles or photos appear in the newspapers she won't perform on opening night. During Ted's visit to Lucy's apartment, she confesses her increasing affection towards him by singing the film's most famous song, \"I've Got You Under My Skin.\"\nPeppy Turner reprises \"Easy to Love\" in a rehearsal of Lucy's show while the limber-limbed Mush, now out of the Navy, dances around her.\nLucy gets more and more upset. She doesn't like a costume and thinks the song's arrangement is undanceable. McKay asks Nora to dance to the arrangement, which she does brilliantly. When Lucy realizes what is happening, she demands McKay fire Nora, which, reluctantly, he does.\nJenny confesses to Ted, who is also out of the Navy now, that Sally is her child, not Nora's and that Nora loves him. She also tells him about Nora getting fired from the show. Ted calls the press and gives them a cooked up story. When the next morning headlines proclaim that Lucy James is going to marry an ex-sailor, she stays true to her threat and won't go on (which means, of course, that her understudy, Nora, would become the show's star).\nThe film's finale is a gigantic production number from the show, \"Great Guns.\" Set on an Art Deco battleship, it opens with Peppy singing \"Swingin' the Jinx Away,\" backed by a male chorus of singers and dancers. After some acrobatics by sailors, Mush takes his turn with the tune as he sings and dances backed by a female chorus of singers and dancers in front of the ship's stylized guns. After more singing by the male and female chorus, Peppy and the Foursome perform more of the song. Finally, Nora makes her entrance down the spiral stairs of the ship's superstructure and then slides to the stage via a pole. Dressed in a stylized drum major outfit, she taps to \"Swingin' the Jinx Away\" and then leads the band and chorus in \"Hurrah for the Red, White and Blue,\" a very patriotic finale for a non-wartime movie.\nJust before the credits roll, Ted congratulates Nora on a splendid performance and Jenny finally tells Gunny he's a father (unfortunately, he has already signed up for four more years in the Navy)."

Kinney tells Chan that he has been receiving death threats, after which Kinney and Gaines quarrel over money. Kinney then tries to discipline Caesar, the circus' ape, but the handler, Hal Blake, warns Kinney that he treats Caesar too roughly. Hal seeks solace from his girlfriend, Louise Norman, whose sister, aerialist Marie, is Kinney's fiancee.As the show goes on, Chan leaves his family to meet Kinney and discuss his problems. When he arrives at Kinney's wagon, however, Chan, Gaines, and dancing midgets Tim and Tiny discover that Kinney has been murdered. Because the wagon was locked from the inside, and because of the hairs found on the window sill, the others suspect that Caesar climbed through the window and killed Kinney. Chan, however, withholds judgment and turns the case over to Lieutenant Macy, then leaves with his family to continue their vacation.Later that night, however, Tiny appears at their hotel and pleads with Chan to continue the investigation to clear Tim and Gaines, who are being held for questioning. Chan convinces Macy to release Tim and Gaines and to allow the circus to travel on, in hopes that the killer will reveal himself as time passes. Chan, his son Lee and Macy travel with the circus and, despite an attempt on Chan's life that night, reach their destination the next day. They discover that the business wagon's safe has been broken into, and in the safe they find Kinney's insurance policy, naming Marie as the beneficiary, and a marriage certificate stating that Kinney and wardrobe mistress Nellie Farrell were married in Juarez, Mexico on 30 May.The trio later confronts Nellie and her brother Dan, and Nellie asserts that, as Kinney's widow, she is entitled to his half of the circus. Marie retorts that Nellie's claim is false, as Kinney could not have been in Juarez on that date, but before she can offer proof, she has to perform her act. While Marie is in the air, someone shoots her rigging and she falls to the ground. She is seriously injured and the doctor Chan summons states that she must be operated on immediately.While the doctor is tending to Marie, Chan looks through her scrapbook and discovers that on May 30, Kinney was being held as a witness to a murder in El Paso. While Lee telephones the El Paso police for more information, Caesar is released from his cage. Caesar attempts to kill Marie during the operation but is caught, after which Chan reveals that it is not the true Caeser who was apprehended, but snake handler Tom Holt, disguised as the ape. The police confirm that Holt was the killer in El Paso, and Chan deduces that Kinney covered up for Holt but was later murdered by Holt when they quarreled over money. Holt then attempted to murder Marie, who is safely recovering at a hospital, because she could reveal the El Paso incident. Holt is arrested, along with Nellie and Dan, who forged the marriage certificate after Kinney's death. Gaines promises Chan lifetime passes to the circus as a reward for his help, and Lee romances Su Toy, a pretty Asian contortionist whom he had been pursuing throughout the investigation."

Inspector Regan calls Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) in on the case, and as they are in his office discussing it, Lilli comes in, accompanied by her lover and fellow singer, Enrico Barelli, to complain about a threat stating she will die that night. Chan agrees to go to the opera that night, along with Sergeant Kelly, to investigate.Later at the theater, Phil Childers and his girl friend Kitty try to see Lilli but are turned away by Kelly just as Regan and Chan arrive and hear Lilli's husband Whitely and Enrico fighting over Lilli. Meanwhile, in the dressing room of Enrico's wife Anita, Gravelle appears, and although Anita is terrified because he was presumed dead in a theater fire years ago, she agrees to keep his presence a secret while he carries out his plan of singing Enrico's role on stage. Gravelle then menaces Enrico, who, along with Lilli, locked Gravelle in the burning theater, and soon it is Gravelle rather than Enrico who joins Lilli on stage for their duet. Lilli recognizes Gravelle's voice and faints after she leaves the stage.After Whitely carries Lilli off, the others rush to Enrico's room, only to find that he has been stabbed. While the others search for Gravelle, Phil enters Lilli's room and discovers that she is also dead. Whitely comes in and has Phil arrested, but when Chan questions Phil and Kitty, they tell him that Kitty is Lilli's daughter from her previous marriage to Gravelle and that Lilli refused to acknowledge Kitty in order to keep her past a secret. The young lovers were there to ask Lilli for her permission to marry, as Kitty is underage. Gravelle, who did not recognize Kitty, is stunned as he overhears.Later, Phil goes to see Regan, leaving Kitty alone, and Gravelle comes in. He gently questions her and plays the piano for her, but she does not remember him and faints from fright. Chan enters, and after Gravelle tells him about Lilli and Enrico's attempt to kill him, Chan flatters him into singing again. Chan arranges to have Anita sing Lilli's role, and during the duet, which involves Gravelle's character stabbing Anita's character, Anita becomes so scared that a police officer shoots Gravelle. Chan then demonstrates that Gravelle's knife is a prop and could not have been used in the murders. He explains that Anita was the only one who had access to Enrico and Lilli when they were alone and unconscious, and that she was also the only one who knew Gravelle was there and could therefore frame him. Anita confesses that jealousy drove her to kill her husband and his lover, and after she is taken away, Chan convinces Kitty to comfort injured Gravelle, thereby saving his life."

        "summary": "When a friend of Charlie's is found kicked to death by his own race horse on board a Honolulu-bound liner, the detective discovers foul play and uncovers an international gambling ring.",
        "sinopsis": "After jockey \"Tip\" Collins, riding Avalanche, the horse in the lead in the Melbourne Sweepstakes, fouls another rider, Avalanche is disqualified. Major Gordon Kent, who gave Avalanche as a wedding present to the internationally known American sportsman George Chester when Chester married his daughter Catherine, believes that a big gambling ring is behind the foul. The major has a wire sent to his old friend, the renowned detective Charlie Chan, instructing him to meet their boat in Honolulu on their way to compete in America. However, on the voyage, the major dies seemingly from being kicked by Avalanche in his stall. Chan determines from the position and the shape of the bloodstains that the horse could not have kicked the major.After Chan reveals to his chief and the ship's captain a piece of the ship's winch, the twin of which is missing, which could make a shape identical to that of a horseshoe, the chief suggests that Chan travel with the boat to investigate what they now suspect is a murder. When Chester receives a typed note warning him not to enter Avalanche in the Santa Juanita Handicap, Chan's son Lee, who, against his father's wishes, got on the boat as a cabin boy, determines that the note came from the typewriter of the major's competitor, Warren Fenton. A number of other passengers next receive notes: Fenton, who offered Chester $20,000 for the horse; Bruce Rogers, the major's assistant, who is in love with Fenton's daughter Alice; Denny Barton, who also loves Alice, but whom she has rebuked; and Chester again. After a fire breaks out in the forward hold where Avalanche is kept, Chan is hit in the leg by a bullet fired accidentally by Chester.In Los Angeles harbor, Chan notices that a monkey, who earlier caused Avalanche to bolt, now causes Fenton's horse Gladstone to go wild, while Avalanche does not mind the monkey. Chan suspects that the fire was used as a cover so that the horses could be switched and Fenton's horse could then win the upcoming race with good odds. The switch, involving the application of black dye to Gladstone, was engineered by Avalanche's trainer Bagley working with a gang of gamblers.On the day of the race, Lee creates a diversion so that Chan can enter the stables and switch the horses. Bagley, after noticing the switch, is arrested as he calls a gambler. As the race begins, Al Meers, a track employee in league with the gamblers, switches a device at the three-quarter pole, which is used to time the race, with one fitted with a dart. As Avalanche, in the lead, passes the pole, the dart hits the horse. Avalanche wins anyway, but then falls. As a crowd surrounds Avalanche, someone removes the dart. Chan then gathers Denny, Bagley, Meers, Chester and Fenton in the racing association office. When the dart is found in Fenton's pocket, Fenton accuses Denny of putting it there, but Chester accuses Fenton of wanting to buy Avalanche all along and of murdering Major Kent with the winch shoe because the major would have noticed that the horses had been switched. Chan then points out that no one other than himself, his chief, the captain of the ship and the murderer knew about the winch shoe. He says that he suspected Chester all along because Chester, who admits that he suffered gambling losses, did not use his glasses to read the first threatening note he received, which Chester himself sent to throw off suspicion, but that he did use his glasses to read the second note, which Chan, with Lee's help, sent. Chan then reveals blood stains from the dart in the lining of Chester's pocket. Fenton confesses that he knew of the plot to switch horses and tells the commissioner that he will remove his horses from the track. Bruce wins enough money from the race to furnish a flat for himself and Alice. When the ever-enthusiastic Lee pops in with what he thinks is a hot clue, Chan requests that he save it for their next case."

        "sinopsis": "During the search for bodies among the wreckage of a boat lost in a storm near Hawaii, detective Charlie Chan finds a diary of Alan Coleby, heir to his father's fortune, which indicates that he was on board and that attempts had recently been made on his life. Chan cables Henrietta Lowell, matriarch of the family and the sister of Alan's deceased father, that Alan's fate is uncertain and flies to San Francisco where Mrs. Lowell, a devoted believer in \"psychic research,\" schedules a séance. Alan returns to the Coleby estate, but upon entering, he is hit by a thrown dagger.The séance is conducted by Carlotta, a medium, and attended by her husband, Professor Bowan, whom Mrs. Lowell supports financially; Mrs. Lowell's two daughters, Alice and Janice; Alice's boyfriend, newspaper reporter Dick Williams; Janice's husband, Fred Gage; Ulrich, a disgruntled servant, who blames his daughter's suicide seven years earlier on Alan for breaking his engagement with her; and Chan. Alan's face appears in the darkened room, and when the lights are turned on, Chan discovers that Alan has been murdered.Chan arranges with Mrs. Lowell to spend the night in the house, which has many secret panels and passages, to investigate. Curious, Mrs. Lowell sneaks away from her home to join Chan in his search for clues. They find a radio receiver, which, Chan surmises, may account for the music they heard during the séance. They also discover that Alan's image appeared when a hidden ultraviolet light was directed toward his face, which was covered with quinine sulfite, a solution that glows when hit by ultraviolet light. Greatly upset, Mrs. Lowell reveals that Professor Bowan knew that if Alan were to return, her patronage would cease. As she agrees with Chan's suggestion that she revise her will, now that she is the legal heir, a shot is fired at her from a hidden doorway, but Chan pushes her out of the way. Just then, Gage enters the house and says that he came because he feared for his mother-in-law's safety.The next day, after seeing a radio transmitter in Ulrich's room, Chan visits Carlotta, who admits the use of the transmitter. She is shocked, however, to learn about the ultraviolet ray. When Chan touches her shortwave coil, Bowan switches on the current, which causes Chan to fall unconscious. Just then, the police arrive, but Bowan escapes. Inspector Morton arrests Carlotta as Chan is revived.Later that day, Mrs. Lowell announces to her family that she plans to sign a new will, which her executor Warren T. Phelps will bring at 8:30 that evening. As the church bells ring at 8:30 and Phelps drives up, Mrs. Lowell is shot through the window. Chan investigates the bell tower and finds a high powered rifle, which had been set to fire at the window when the bell was rung. After Bowan is caught, and he does not confess, Chan calls all the attendees at the first séance back and has Carlotta conduct a new one. When Mrs. Lowell's animated image appears, and it starts to speak, a dagger is thrown at the image, which cracks as the mirror on which it is reflected breaks. When the lights are turned on, Chan reveals that Mrs. Lowell is alive and that a dummy was earlier shot. Gage accuses Ulrich and they struggle, but Chan, who had put graphite on the knife, reveals graphite on Gage's hands and accuses Gage of murdering Alan Coleby to cover evidence of forgery in the Lowell accounts. After Gage is led away, charges are dropped against Carlotta and Bowan, who agree to leave town, and Chan plans to return to his large family in Honolulu."

They take Van Helsing into custody because \"this is a case for Scotland Yard.\" Dracula's body is stolen by his daughter, the Countess Marya Zaleska [Gloria Holden]. Looking for release from the Dracula curse, she burns his body.Meanwhile, psychologist Jeffrey Garth [Otto Kruger]is called in to defend Van Helsing. Garth meets the Countess at a party, and she confesses to him that she is looking for release from 'an obsession'. He visits with the Countess, much to the dismay of his girlfriend and assistant Janet Blake [Marquerite Churchill]. Unbeknown to Garth, the Countess and her assistant Sander [Irving Pichel] search at night for young women to pose as models but really so that the Countess can drink their blood. One night, Lili [Nan Gray] is found in a 'post-hypnotic trance' with marks on her neck. Garth is called in, and he calls in Van Helsing. The diagnosis is 'wampire'.The Countess comes to Garth's office. She has decided to return to Transylvania and wants Garth to accompany her. He hedges and, while he's busy with Lili, the Countess and Sander abduct Janet. Lili reveals enough to cue Garth to the Countess's intent, but she has left for Transylvania with the entranced Janet. Garth pursues them. The Countess offers him a deal: \"I'll release (Janet) if you'll stay with me.\" Realizing that the Countess has abandoned him for Garth, Sander shoots an arrow through her heart. As he re-arms to shoot Garth, Van Helsing and Scotland Yard arrive, and they shoot Sander. Janet awakens from the trance. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

        "sinopsis": "The film begins with Joe Wilson and Katherine Grant window-shopping together. They are looking at a bedroom set in a store window, and we learn that Joe and Katherine are engaged but cannot afford to get married. As they walk down the street Joe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handful of peanuts. It begins to rain and Joe wonders out loud why it had to rain that night of all nights. Katherine reassures him and they kiss under a bridge as a train rolls by.Joe and Katherine are next seen at the train station where Joe's coat gets caught on a handrail and tears. Katherine fishes a needle and blue thread out of her suitcase and insists on fixing the tear for Joe before she leaves Katherine has found work in another city and is leaving to save up money for her and Joe's wedding. Just as she finishes her sewing her train arrives and Joe and Katherine walk onto the platform. Outside Joe buys Katherine a souvenir, telling Katherine that he bought it as a momentum. Katherine corrects him, telling him, It's memento darling, not momentum. Joe tells Katherine the mistake is an old habit of his from wearing braces as a kid and Katherine tells Joe that he is still a kid in many ways. Katherine has a gift for Joe too a ring that was once her mothers. The inscription inside reads From Henry to Katherine to Joe. The train whistles and as Katherine boards the train Joe promises her that he will come for her soon.Outside of the train station Joe hears a bark and discovers a small, shaggy black stray. Joe tells the dog, You look the way I feel, lonely and small. He brings the dog back home with him and names her Rainbow. Not long after arriving home Joe's two brothers Tom and Charlie come home from the movies. Tom is drunk and Charlie explains that after seeing a movie they had a few drinks with Donelli, a local crime boss. Joe urges his brothers to leave their life of crime and go straight. Charlie tells Joe not to interfere with his life and leaves.In the town of Strand Katherine has settled into her new apartment. She is looking through a stack of letters mailed to her from Joe. Joe writes that his brothers decided to leave behind their life of crime and that the three of them opened up their own gas station. Joe has been saving up money and will soon have enough for their wedding. Katherine's landlady arrives with a telegram marked special delivery. Katherine rips it open and reads that not only does Joe finally has enough money for their wedding but that he has bought a car as well and is on his way to come get Katherine.Back in Chicago Joe packs up his new car and says his goodbyes to his brothers. Halfway to Strand he stops for the night and camps out in the woods. While eating dinner over a campfire the newspaper headline reads KIDNAP RANSOM PAID. As Joe is camping out Katherine is preparing a picnic lunch for her and Joe. She tells her landlady that she is planning on meeting Joe at a local hot dog stand at 11. The next morning while driving down an old dirt road Joe is stopped by Bugs Meyers, a local police officer. Bugs notices Joe's Illinois license plate and orders him to keep his hands on the wheel. Joe assures him he doesn't have a gun, just some peanuts. Bugs asks Joe if the peanuts are whole shell and when Joe tells him that they are he orders Joe out of his car and brings him to the county jail.At the county jail the sheriff asks Joe about where he had been the night before and Joe answers him truthfully. The sheriff looks at a report from the ransom case that was in the newspapers which says that an examination of the ransom note revealed that it had been carried in a pocket along with peanuts. Suspicious of Joe, the sheriff offers him some peanuts. Joe cheerfully tells the sheriff that he loves peanuts and always carries them in his pockets. The sheriff interrogates Joe again about his whereabouts the night before and Joe asks what he is being suspected of. The sheriff hands Joe a reward flyer for the capture of any of the men associated with the kidnapping of Helen Peabody. The description of one of the kidnappers meets Joe along with his keeping peanuts in his pocket. Joe insists that he is innocent and urges the sheriff to call his brothers to clear his name. The sheriff tells him he will but first asks Joe to empty his pockets. Joe does so willingly, eager to clear his name. Among his possessions are a few dollar bills and the sheriff asks Bugs to cross reference the serial numbers on Joe's money with a list of serial numbers from the ransom money. One of Joe's $5 bills matches but Joe insists that he does not know where he got the money from and tells the sheriff that it likely came from his gas station. Bugs searches Joe's car but finds no further incriminating evidence. The sheriff puts Joe in jail and assures him he will look into Joe's case.Bugs decides to go next door to the barber shop where one of the customers is threatening a local high school teacher to get a law banning the teaching of radical ideas in schools. The teacher calmly replies that it's not possible to pass a law that takes away ones right to say what they believe because the constitution protects that right. One of the barbers, an immigrant named Sven, suggests to the customer that he read it some time. The customer changes the subject by asking Bugs about the kidnapping case and Bugs tells him he arrested a man that morning that might know something about the kidnappers. Sven wonders out loud what causes a man to kidnap a child and the other barber comments that all men have wild impulses; those who can control those impulses are sane and those who can not either wind up in a mental ward or in jail. The barber tells his customer that he often has an impulse to shave off mens adams apples. He turns his back to his customer and tells Bugs, \"An impulse is an impulse. It's like an itch, you gotta scratch it.\" When he turns back around his customer is nowhere to be found and the front door is swinging. Angry, the barber calls his wife and tells her that he lost one of his regular customers because of Bugs Meyers bringing the news that one of the kidnappers had been caught. After hanging up the phone, the barbers wife runs next door to tell her neighbor and soon the news spreads all over town.At the local bar three members from the towns city council are discussing Joe's arrest. One suggests that his conviction would be good publicity for their town. Another suggests that they go down to the jail themselves to speak to the sheriff about the case and the rest of the men agree. At the county jail the sheriff tells the city council men that he is trying to get ahold of the district attorney and that until then he can not comment on Joe's arrest. The city council men urge the sheriff to make a statement anyway because the town deserves to know about the kidnapper. The sheriff points out that they don't know if he is the kidnapper yet and the city council men leave dejected. As they walk out onto the street there is a small group of people waiting who throw rocks through the windows of the building, presumably because of the lack of information. The sheriff calls the district attorney who reassures the sheriff they will be prepared in case of a national emergency.Back at the bar a group of men have gathered, angry that the sheriff would not tell them the facts about Joe's case. Rumors have been circulating that Joe had up to ten thousand dollars in his car. Bugs walks into the bar and the men begin demanding information from him about Joe. Bugs tells the men that he didn't find a single thing in Joe's car and that the only ransom money he had on him was a single five dollar bill. The crowd becomes unruly and starts to discuss going back down to the county jail. One bar patron shouts for every one to be quiet and tells the other men that they are getting too excited and that Joe's case was none of their business. A stranger in the bar steps forward to say that if this were his town he would make it his business and calls then men in the bar soft boiled for letting a kidnapped girl go without vengeance. The bar patron asks who he is and the stranger replies that he is just passing through. The other men in the bar begin to agree that the stranger is right and an angry mob marches down to the county jail.The sheriff and his men stand guard in front of the jail with tear gas as Joe watches the scene helplessly from his cell window on the second floor. The mob demands to speak with Joe and the sheriff tells them that there is no proof that he is guilty or innocent and assures them that the district attorney is looking into his case. He also reminds the mob that Joe is protected by the law and tells them that the National Guard is on their way. The scene quickly changes to the district attorneys office where the governor is stopping the order to call in the National Guard. When asked why, his explanation is that people always resent troops moving in on them and that the district attorney could cut [their] political throats.Back at the jail the crowd is getting more and more rowdy. The sheriff tells them to use their heads and reminds them that they are up against the law. The mob responds by throwing food and rocks at the sheriff and his men.At the hot dog stand Katherine is still waiting anxiously for Joe, having no idea that he was arrested that morning. The restaurant owner tells Katherine that the police in Strand arrested a man they suspected of being involved with the kidnappers named Joe Wilson. Hysterical, Katherine begs the restaurant owner to loan her his car and screams at him that she has to go.At the jail the mob has become increasingly unruly and the sheriff and his men have had to retreat back into the jailhouse. From a nearby building a cameraman and his crew see the mob and set up their camera to capture the event. The mob below begins to ram down the door to the jail and Joe screams at the sheriff that he will talk to the mob if he would just give Joe a chance. Meanwhile Katherine is running down the street, trying to flag down passing cars but no one will stop for her.At the jail the mob knocks down the front door and storms inside. The sheriff uses tear gas and tries to hose the men back but they pile through the door and knock the sheriff unconscious. The mob runs upstairs and demands the key from the jailer but he insists that he doesn't have it. One of the men begins to choke the jailer and he points to where they keys are laying on the floor, slid under one of the locked jail cells.Katherine finally arrives at the county jail, having traveled there on foot. The mob outside is calm and quiet and Katherine realizes that the jailhouse had been set on fire. Joe is seen, still in his jail cell, holding Rainbow and telling her that things look bad. He peeks his head through the cell window and Katherine sees him helplessly standing there in the burning building. One of the women in the mob falls to her knees and begins to pray but most of the mob is excited by Joe and they begin throwing rocks and food at him. Katherine faints and falls to the floor as Joe disappears into his cell again. A boy runs into the mob shouting, Soldiers are coming! Soldiers are coming! The mob scatters and as they do two strangers notice Katherine laying on the ground and pick her up. At the last minute a few men decide to throw a stick of dynamite into the burning building before running off to keep the National Guard from being able to save Joe.In the next scene the district attorney is seen telling the governor that, the very spirit of government has been violated. He blames himself for letting the governor talk him out of sending in troops. The governor tells him to forget the incident and that the majority of the telegrams they had received about the event were positive. The district attorney asks him what the telegrams will say when people discover that Joe Wilson was innocent. The governor tells him that he didn't know Joe was innocent and the district attorney shows him that days paper. The headline reads, \"KIDNAPPERS CAUGHT; CONFESS. G-MEN NAB WHOLE GANG.\"The scene changes to a Chicago newspaper. The headline reads, \"INNOCENT MAN LYNCHED, BURNED ALIVE BY MOB!\" Charlie tosses the paper into the trashcan, saying, NOW he's innocent! Tom tells him he hasn't slept since the incident because he can't get the thought out of his head every time he closes his eyes. He asks Charlie why they haven't head from Katherine and Charlie shouts that she probably thought Joe was guilty too. Charlie angrily tells Tom he wishes he could get his hands on whoever was responsible and kill them like they killed Joe. Tom agrees and tells Charlie he'll go with him. A dark voice is heard off camera telling Tom and Charlie, \"That's five and ten cent store talk.\" Tom and Charlie turn to see a dark figure standing in the doorway. Tom jumps up, realizing that the man in the door is Joe, but when he sees Joe's hardened face he slowly backs away from his brother. Joe orders his brothers to lower the shades as he steps into the room. Joe has changed dramatically; where he once was a cheery and optimistic man he is now dark and hardened. He sits in an armchair and tells his stunned brothers, \"Do you know where I've been all day? In a movie, watching a newsreel of myself getting burned alive. I've watched it ten times, or twenty maybe. Over and over again I don't know how much. The place was packed. They like it. They get a big kick out of seeing a man getting burned to death. A big kick.\" He explains to his brother that he escaped the jail after the dynamite caused an explosion that knocked apart the building, but killed Rainbow. He burned his side during his escape but tells Tom that it didn't hurt because \"you can't hurt a dead man and I'm dead. Everybody knows that.\" He laughs at himself, remembering all the times he preached to his brothers to be decent and live right. Charlie tells Joe that they'll get a lawyer and Joe tells him that it's not enough that they get charged for disturbing the peace or destroying the jail house; he wants them to be charged for his murder and be sentenced to death themselves but with the chance that Joe never got a legal trial. But Joe needs his brothers help as he is supposed to be dead.Back at Strand a group of women are sitting around a kitchen table. One of them says that it would be a blessing if the whole town could forget about what had happened. The doorbell rings and when one of the women opens it a woman named Mrs. Garret comes in. Mrs. Garret asks if anyone had heard any news about the investigation from her husband. The other woman reassures her that no one in town would name names to save themselves and that many of the townspeople had decided that the lynching was a community matter, not an individual matter, and that everyone should band together against the district attorney.In a hotel in Strand Joe and Charlie are speaking to their lawyer. The lawyer explains that no one in the town will testify to Joe even being at the jail at all and that he can't bring anyone to trial for murder until he can prove that a murder took place. Desperate, Tom and Charlie travel to Katherine's apartment. Katherine's landlady opens the door and explains that Katherine is very sick, but when Tom and Charlie introduce themselves as Joe's brothers she lets them in. Katherine is sitting in an armchair, staring off into the distance. When Tom and Charlie say hello, Katherine does not even acknowledge their existence. The landlady explains that she has been that way since coming home. While he thinks of what they should do Charlie lights a cigarette. When he strikes a match Katherine suddenly turns towards them. The fire of the match brings back Katherine's memories of the jail burning down and Joe's helpless face in the cell window. She begins to scream and Charlie tells Katherine to try and remember who they are. Suddenly Katherine remembers they are Joe's brothers and she tells Charlie that she saw Joe being burnt alive and breaks down into tears. Charlie realizes that Katherine is the witness that can testify to seeing Joe at the jail.Back in the hotel room Joe has arrived in town and is excited about the trial. Charlie is upset that Joe came into town because he could be seen but Joe angrily tells him that he will be in hiding. Tom agrees with Joe wanting to be there and suggests that one day Joe might want to see Katherine. Joe tells his brothers that Katherine is not to know he is alive because she would crack and tell everyone.At the lawyers office the governor is visiting and warning him not to let the trial get out of hand. The governor tells the lawyer that he can't bring a town full of John Does to trial and the lawyer angrily tells him that he is not bringing John Doe to trial but twenty two citizens of Strand who were named as being part of the mob. The scene fades into that of a courthouse where twenty-two people are sitting in court being accused of murdering Joe Wilson. The lawyer is passionately speaking in front of the court, saying that, when a mob takes it upon itself to identify, try, condemn, and punish, it is a destroyer of a government that patriots have died to establish and defend. As the camera pans slowly across the courthouse you can see that the room is overflowing with people and that local radio stations are there to cover the trial. People can be seen listening to the trial on the radio, including Joe who is in his hotel room. As the trial begins the lawyer tells the judge and jury that instead of first establishing the crime he will begin by establishing the whereabouts of the defendants during the commission of the crime. The lawyer calls Edna Hooper to the stand and she is sworn in. Miss Hooper testifies that she is a dressmaker and that on the day of the jail burning down she was at the home of Mr. Garret where he and his wife were at home the whole day. A shot of a clock is shown advancing several hours and the next witness we see is Miss Franchette, the owner of the Green Light Inn. The lawyer asks four of the defendants to stand and asks Miss Franchette if she had seen any of them on the night of the jail fire. Miss Franchette testifies that all four of them were in her café until eleven at night. The lawyer wonders out loud if he hasn't been calling the defense's witnesses by mistake. A radio commentator is seen speaking into a microphone, explaining that the lawyer had been spending the last five hours trying to establish the whereabouts of the defendants. Joe is seen sitting in front of a radio in his hotel room. Just wait, he says out loud, rubbing his hands together.The next witness is the sheriff. The lawyer asks if he can identify the defendants as having been part of the mob that burned down his jail. The sheriff pauses to look at the defendants and finally tells the lawyer that he cannot identify any of them. The lawyer asks if he could name anyone who was part of the mob then and the sheriff replies that he could not and that the men from the mob must have been strangers from out of town. The lawyer asks the sheriff about the injury that he sustained and the sheriff says that while he and his deputies tried to hold off the mob with tear gas and rifle butts he was hit on the head from behind. The lawyer asks if the burning of the jail was an attempted lynching after all and the defense attorney quickly objects to the question. The lawyer retorts that the question was entirely proper as he asked about an attempted lynching. The defense attorney accuses the lawyer of using his sarcasm to hide from the judge and jury the failure of its own witnesses to back up its shallow case. One member of the audience watching the case begins to applaud and accuses the judge of being busted. The judge has the man removed from the courthouse and the rest of the audience becomes angry and restless. One man shouts out that the trial is a shame against the good name of their town and the judge has the man brought before the court. The man shouts that he isn't afraid of the judge, saying he can't do anything. The judge holds the man in contempt and fines him one hundred dollars or ten days in jail. The man protests against this injustice and the judge changes the punishment to two hundred dollars or thirty days in jail and the man is dragged away. The judge announces that if there are any further demonstrations he will have the courthouse cleared.The defense attorney reminds the court that the plaintiffs lawyer had yet to establish that the men on trial were even at the scene of the crime. The lawyer tells the judge that bringing up his witnesses so far was not to prove anything other than the fact that they were all liars and asks that they all be indicted for perjury based on his next piece of evidence. Against the protests of the defense attorney the judge allows the lawyer to bring forth this new piece of evidence footage from the cameraman and his crews camera, which filmed the entire event. As the film reel rolls the lawyer points out the defendants who are seen ramming down the jail door, pouring gasoline on a pile of busted up furniture, lighting the jail on fire, and cutting the firemen's hose in half with an axe. One of the women in the audience stands up, shrieks that it's not true, and faints to the floor. The courthouse becomes chaotic as people run from the room. Reporters rush to the phones to call in the news of the film. Different news headlines flash over the scene such as, \"IDENTITY OF 22 PROVED,\" \"MOVIES IDENTIFY DEFENDANTS IN WILSON LYNCHING TRIAL,\" and \"22 FACE DEATH! JUDGE HOPKINS CLEARS COURT ROOM.\"Charlie, Tom, and Katherine are all seen walking into the courthouse. Charlie is complaining that they're going to be late as the three of them pile into the elevator. Inside the crowded elevator Katherine notices that Tom is wearing Joe's old coat she recognizes the tear she mended with blue thread before she first left for Strand. Charlie asks Tom for a cigarette and when he reaches into his pocket he pulls out a handful of peanuts. The elevator stops and the three of them enter the court room where the defense attorney is telling the judge that so far no one has been able to testify that Joe Wilson was inside the jail when it was set on fire. The lawyer calls Katherine to the stand who is sworn in. Katherine testifies that her and Joe were engaged and that on the day that the jail was burnt down she had prepared a lunch for herself and Joe, bought him some neckties as a gift, and stopped by the ministers office to remind him that they would be by later. She continued, saying that she and Joe had been apart for over a year and that she loved him. Joe listens on the radio from his hotel room and is visibly upset by Katherine's testimony, as is the audience. The defense attorney questions Katherine next, telling her that according to psychology the mind can see what it expects to see, weather it is there or not, and asks Katherine if it is possible that she had not seen Joe but rather a figment of her imagination. Katherine testifies that she is positive she saw him. The defense attorney asks if Katherine is sure that Joe is dead, and Katherine replies that one can assume that he is. Excuse me, the defense attorney tells her, but that is exactly what must not be assumed but proved. The state is asking the lives of twenty-two people for one. Katherine shouts, I don't care about the lives of twenty-two people! They can't bring back the one life I cared about. The defense attorney reminds the jury that they can not charge the defendants for the murder of Joe Wilson if his body was never found and that to prove Joe had died they would need at least a body part or an article known to be worn by the deceased. The defense attorney requests that the judge remove the charges for murder against the defendants. The judge replies that he will take the matter under advisement until the state's arguments have been made the next day. Joe throws his radio onto the ground in anger, breaking it. The headlines the next morning read, \"IS THIS MAN ALIVE?\" along with a picture of Joe.The next day in court the judge announces that he was mailed an object that, if authentic, should be considered as evidence. The judge takes the witness stand and presents the evidence to the lawyer. The evidence is a letter mailed special delivery to the judge containing a ring and a note made from letters cut from a newspaper. The letter states that the sender was a citizen of Strand who helped to clean up after the fire and who picked the ring out from the rubble for a momentum. The lawyer, who is reading the letter aloud, corrects this mistake and reads instead memento. The ring has been melted and warped as if by fire but the lawyer can read the inscription to Joe inside. The defense attorney objects, saying that there is no proof the ring actually belonged to the Joe in question. The lawyer calls Katherine to the witness stand, who testifies that the ring was a gift from her to Joe. A woman in the audience screams suddenly and leaps up, saying that she wanted to confess and that they were all guilty. As she is dragged out of the courthouse she begs for forgiveness. The lawyer tells the jury that the ring is the answer to the case.As the jury deliberates Charlie, Tom, and Katherine sit outside. Katherine comments that they sure were lucky the letter showed up and Tom urges her not to talk about it. Katherine asks, \"Why didn't you tell me Joe was alive?\" Charlie tells Katherine to be quiet but Katherine shouts that he can't keep her quiet and asks whether Joe has realized what he has done. She asks Charlie where he is and Charlie replies that she saw Joe in the fire and accuses her of losing her mind. Katherine says he must be right and tells him that she hasn't been sleeping.Back at the hotel room Charlie tells Joe about how his letter caused Katherine to suspect that he was still alive. Joe shouts that his letter was the best idea he ever had and that losing Katherine's ring was worth it. Joe goes over the events of the trial with his brothers, saying it must have been a sight when that woman fainted. Tom shouts out that he can't take it any longer and accuses Joe of being just as bad as the lynchers. Charlie agrees with Tom and the two of them begin to regret their decision to help avenge Joe. Tom begs Joe to tell the judge he's alive but Joe calmly pulls a gun out from his pocket and aims it at Tom, telling him he would kill him first. From off camera Katherine tells Joe he might as well kill her too. Joe quickly stands, knocking over his chair to see Katherine standing in the doorway. Joe accuses his brothers of telling Katherine but she tells him that she figured it out on her own when she saw Joes misspelling of the word memento. She begs Joe to kill her saying, what difference does it make? Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-five? Katherine calms down for a moment and tells Joe that she understands how he feels and why he feels that way but she wants them to be happy and have the life they always planned to have together. Joe tells her, You ought to have a couple of violins playing when you talk like that. Katherine pleads with him to understand that the people being held on trial were part of a mob and that mobs don't have time to stop and think but Joe tells her that it's their turn to know what it's like to be lynched. Katherine shouts that they have had enough because they have had to deal with this trial for months, wishing they could go back in time and re-live that one day. She pleads Joe to go to the judge and confess so that they can be happy together again. She tells him, If those people die Joe Wilson dies, you know that. Joe shouts that he doesn't need anybody and that he is going to go out into the world alone.Joe goes out to a restaurant where he is sitting alone at a table. A live band is playing and the dance floor is crowded with couples. Joe orders bourbon but the waiter says with their license they can't serve hard alcohol. Joe leaves, telling the waiter that he doesn't like crowded places. He walks down the street and stops at a window display of bedroom furniture similar to the one Katherine and he were admiring at the beginning of the film. He hears Katherine's phantom voice asking him if he is planning on doing a lot of running around in that bedroom but when Joe turns Katherine is nowhere to be found. Across the street he spots a bar and decides to go inside for a drink. When he opens the door the bar is empty except for the bartender who asks what he drinks. Joe orders a double bourbon and sits at the bar to sip his drink. The clock chimes midnight and the bartender walks over to the calendar to rip the page off but the pages become stuck together and when he tears them away the date is the 22nd. Joe jumps back in surprise and throws his money on the counter, leaving quickly. Walking down the street Joe stops at a flower shop whose windows are filled with white lilies. The image of the twenty-two people charged with Joe's murder fills Joe's mind and he hears Katherine's phantom voice again from their conversation earlier asking, What difference does it make? Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-five? Joe turns around but Katherine is not there, the streets are empty. He runs back to his hotel room shouting for Katherine but when he gets inside it is empty. \"Don't leave me alone,\" Joe says as he looks around the empty room.At court the next day the jury has reached a verdict. The bailiff begins to read the verdict out loud. The first two men are found not guilty, but the names following theirs are all found guilty. One man jumps up out of his seat, shouting that it wasn't him and he isn't guilty. The other men begin to shout as well and one man leaps over their chairs and attempts to make a run for it. He is stopped in his tracks by Joe Wilson who is calmly walking towards the judge. Joe stands before the judge and tells him that he is Joe Wilson and that he knows that by coming clean about being alive he is saving the lives of those twenty two people but that isn't why he is there. Joe tells the judge, \"I don't care anything about saving them. They're murderers. I know the law says they're not because I'm still alive, but that's not their fault. And the law doesn't know that a lot of things that were very important to me, silly things maybe like a belief in justice and an idea that men were civilized and a feeling of pride that this country of mine was different from all others. The law doesn't know that those things were burned to death within me that night\". Joe continues by saying that he came to the court for his own sake and that he hopes that after he has paid for what he has done he will have a chance to begin life over again. Katherine runs forward and she and Joe embrace and kiss."

        "sinopsis": "Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. was born to an upper-middle class family in the late 19th century. From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines. Anna Held became household synonyms for what's beautiful and fashionable, Flo's accountant stopped seeing red in the books.By 1907, Flo and Anna had been married for some time and Flo found it boring to feature only one girl in a show. He wanted to produce a show featuring girls, lots of girls; and the stage would be so big that even the audience in the last row would be able to see the performance. Flo sold the idea to Billings, Billings sold it to famous producer Erlanger; and so began 24 years of the Zigfeld Follies.Flo's endless affairs, especially the one with Follies star Audrey Dane, eventually ruined his marriage and Anna divorced him. He later fell in love with stage actress Billie Burke, they got married and had a daughter named Patricia.Flo's extravagant lifestyle and debt began to catch up on him. In 1929, Billie sold all of her jewelry to finance Flo's new shows. He made a Zigfeld-style comeback with four hit shows running simoutaneously on Boardway. But Flo's glory was short-lived, the stock market crash ruined everyone and Flo lost everything.An old and beaten Flo became seriously ill and Billie had to work to support him. After a visit from old friend Billings, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. died his apartment, located right across the street from the Ziegfeld Theatre sign."

        "sinopsis": "THE INVISIBLE RAY synopsisDiane Rukh (Frances Drake) stares out the window from their home in the Carpathian Mountains upon the road below. Mother Rukh (Violet Kemble Cooper), seated in a chair, inquires whether her son Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) is still working in his lab. Diane confirms this, saying that he is preparing for the delegation of scientists due to arrive from England. Rising from her chair with help from Diane, Mother Rukh comes to the window with her cane.\nShe tells Diane that on a day like this her son Janos discovered the ray from Andromeda while working with his late father. It was holding the lens during that discovery which caused her permanent blindness. They discuss the brilliance of Janos and how he was rejected by other scientists and called a charlatan. Diane says she was told to watch for the headlights coming and notify Janos. Mother Rukh returns to her seat and Diane looks out the window again. Seeing the car approaching, she announces that she will go tell her husband. She dons her cape and goes through an outer walkway to another building where she rings a bell and enters. Coming into the lab, she tells Janos (who is gazing through a large telescope) that the visitors are arriving. He says he is ready and confident.The car pulls up and several people get out and enter the house. Diane greets Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi) who introduces her husband Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford), Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton). They are introduced to Mother Rukh who speaks but remains seated. Janos enters and greets each one and is greeted by Lady Arabella who presents her nephew Ronald who she says is a mapmaker and will be valuable to the work in Africa. Janos tells them he has a presentation to show them.In the lab, he shows his telescope, explaining and showing a device which will capture a ray from Andromeda containing pictures and information from thousands of years ago. Dr. Benet looks at Sir Francis with a knowing look of doubt between them. Janos attaches the device to the telescope and tells them to wait a few moments while he prepares the projector. Coming back from another room wearing a welding mask, he reaches into a panel and starts a series of electrical devices which give off sparks and energy. He announces he is ready. Diane leads the way to seats which are protected from dangerous rays by a new kind of barium crown glass, which is explained by Janos. He tells them about the distances the ray has traveled and turns on the projector, which is the type used in planetariums to show outer space. As he narrates, the picture shows a movement that passes our moon, Saturn, Orion and finally Andromeda. He tells Sr. Francis that he had previously predicted a meteor which struck Earth many years ago in Africa, telling him that this will prove it. As they watch, the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made, saying this is no hoax.Back in the house, brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos, asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts, but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile, at a camp in Nigeria, Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent, hot, tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away, not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other, but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message, telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for, but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp, but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other, but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane, who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent, she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald, who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet, Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing, sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives, he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave, he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector, he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to, but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away, Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this, the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern, he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on, the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think, the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies, and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming, Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern, hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him, Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night, but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent, he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear, Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet, entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him, saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly, they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile, Dr. Benet wakes Janos, and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand, he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time, but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship, saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings, calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him, he is told they followed the sound of the drums, which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later, he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife, telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos, who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside, Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes, hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments, she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do, but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go, for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy, he says, keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients, using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working, Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city, Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope, she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind."

About the same height and build, they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane, who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead, his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving, Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself, Benet, Diane, Ronald, Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church, he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home, Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs, one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down, the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come, saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room, they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them, he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper, telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue, he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella, the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out, the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths, saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that, saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet, Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture, the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist, Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him, introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture, the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn, who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside, Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun, Benet looks around and heads for the outside door, opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off, showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun, Janos grabs his arm, killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened, revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again, he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing, he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake, taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this, Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip, destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke, he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away, he goes upstairs and crashes through a window, falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope, she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind."

        "sinopsis": "It's a snowy, cold Christmas in 1880's Brooklyn, New York, USA. \"I never saw a man meet death with finer courage,\" says the doctor.Mrs. Errol (Dolores Costello Barrymore) comes out of the room where Captain Errol had died. She tells her young son Cedric (Freddie Bartholomew) that Father is finally better (but mother and son are now all alone in the world).Now it's spring and Cedric's ninth birthday.Cedric's mother and their maid Mary (Una O'Connor) give Cedric birthday gifts including a new bicycle. Cedric rides the bike out to show his Brooklyn friends.The local applewoman, Mrs. McGillicuddy, a poor Brooklyn street vendor (Jessie Ralph), talks to Cedric and admires his new bike.Later, a gang of older boys stop his bicycle riding and taunt Cedric Errol about his British accent. He says he's an American and firmly adds \"My father was English, if it's any of your affair.\"When these boys insult his mother, he fights them single-handedly, until his good friend Dick Tipton (Mickey Rooney) drops his shoeshine equipment and joins Cedric in the fight.A friendly Irish-American cop (Robert Emmett O'Connor) breaks up the fight and the big boys scatter. Officer O'Brien smiles and assures Cedric that he knew Cedric and Dick would have won, but he just didn't want them to be \"commitin' murder.\"Cedric then visits Hobbs' Fancy Vegetables (&) Groceries and his friend, store owner Mr. Hobbs (Guy Kibbee). He sits on a cracker barrel and listens to Mr. Hobbs rail against British nobility. Mr. Hobbs tells Cedric how he considers British earls a bad lot, waving his newspaper as he, a staunch American, exclaims, \"I''ll have no graspin' tyrants [earls] sittin' around on MY cracker barrels!\"Dick arrives, and the three start to celebrate Ceddie's birthday, just getting into one swig of ginger pop before maid Mary bustles in to fetch Cedric home, \"...where strange things happenin' to us,\" she says.British lawyer Mr. Havisham (Henry Stephenson) has come to America by order of Cedric's unseen paternal grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. Mr. Havisham explains that young Cedric is now the only living heir to his British grandfather's title and estates.Mrs. Errol reluctantly agrees to bring Cedric to Britain since her husband, the late Captain Errol, would have wished it. Mr. Havisham warns Mrs. Errol that the old Earl does not wish to see her as he is quite prejudiced against Americans and is fixed in his determination not to see her. She, thus, cannot enter the Dorincourt Estates but must live in a home nearby where Cedric can visit.Distressed, Mrs. Errol accepts the home but refuses the money offered with the house, as she has a small income of her own. She also asks that Mr. Havisham not tell Cedric why she must live apart, as it would make it harder for Cedric and his grandfather to be friends. Mr. Havisham assures her that Cedric will thank her for this someday, when he's a man.Cedric enters, and before a word is spoken, Mr. Havisham is visibly impressed by the lad's poise. Cedric greets the stranger courteously. When Mr. Havisham calls him little Lord Fauntleroy, Ceddie turns to his mother for an explanation. She says the earl has no more children and, very lonely, has invited them to live with him in England. Cedric will henceforth be known as Lord Fauntleroy and will someday become an earl. Cedric asks if he HAS to go - none of the other boys (he knows) get to be earls. \"What will Mr. Hobbs say?\"Back in Mr. Hobbs' store, young Cedric nervously recalls their earlier discussion about no earls allowed to sit on Hobbs' cracker barrels. He confesses, \"Mr. Hobbs, an earl is sitting on this barrel now.\" Astonished, Mr. Hobbs blames the heat. Cedric explains that he'll now be known as Lord Fauntleroy. \"Well, I'll be jiggered,\" says Mr. Hobbs. Sadly, there's no way out of it. Each takes a cookie and nibbles in silence, together.Later, Mr. Havisham enjoys dinner at the Errols' small Brooklyn home. He and Cedric talk about what an earl is. With Cedric's mother called away by Bridget (a needy neighbor whose husband Michael can't work because he's sick), the topic turns to money. Mr. Havisham keenly studies Cedric's reaction towards having it, but Cedric's first thoughts are towards using it to better the lives of those he knows. He'd also buy beautiful things for Dearest. (He tells Mr. Havisham \"I call Mother \"Dearest\" because Father did.\") As for himself, it would be a pony, but that would be too much to even dream about.Mr. Havisham gives Cedric money as a gift from his grandfather, which Cedric immediately runs out to give to Bridget. He returns to report that Bridget cried for joy at the money, which he never saw anyone do before, and surmises that his grandfather must be a very good man and that going to be an earl is more agreeable that he first thought.It's moving day. En route to the ship, the new Lord Fauntleroy stops to say goodbye to his three favorite friends: the applewoman (who wears a warm new shawl from Cedric, and who gives him a free apple for his long journey), Dick Tipton (in front of his new shoeshine stand from Cedric, where Dick gives Cedric an extraordinary handkerchief, and where the two boys stand awkwardly, not knowing how to express their sadness at parting), and Mr. Hobbs (who gets a new pipe and an engraved watch for remembrance).In Britain, Mrs. Errol, in her new home near Dorincourt Estate (where maid Mary introduces her new cook and parlormaid), tells Cedric they must live apart; however, she promises they will see each other daily and Cedric, initially upset, becomes a little more cheerful.That evening, Mr. Havisham enters Dorincourt Castle. A distressed servant reports that these past few weeks have been the worst. Gout, you know. The old Earl is heard (off camera) yelling \"You idiot...!\" at another servant for bringing the wrong wine.Mr. Havisham reports to the Earl about Cedric's safe arrival in Britain. The old Earl is surprised and suspicious that Mrs. Errol will not take the extra income from him. Mr. Havisham suggests that the Earl not speak disparagingly of Cedric's mother to her young son as she has all his affection.The next day, young Cedric rides up with Mr. Havisham to meet the old Earl, his grandfather, on the grand Dorincourt Estate. After greeting the household staff (who are all delighted to meet the new Little Lord Fauntleroy), he enters - alone - into the great library where sits the old Earl (Sir C. Aubrey Smith) and his large great dane dog. Quickly befriended by the Earl's large dog, Cedric walks with it across the large library. \"Are you the Earl? I'm your grandson that Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy!\" He extends his small hand to his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. They shake.The old Earl is impressed with young Cedric's intelligent conversation on various subjects. He learns many amazing things about the new Little Lord Fauntleroy. He learns that his grandson cares for his humble Brooklyn friends (Bridget, Dick and the applewoman), was thinking of being a grocer but would go into the House of Lords if that is a good business, and has decided views about influencing world politics, even declaring, \"Mr. Hobbs says that if there's ever to be another war, that I would HAVE to be in America, but I promised him that if there were to be another war, I should try to stop it.\"Dinner is served, and Cedric, noting his grandfather's sensitive foot, offers his shoulder to lean on as they head for the dining room.The amazed Earl (used to receiving only contempt and fear from others) uncharacteristically comforts the young boy as he becomes homesick for his mother.The next day, local minister Mr. Mordaunt calls on the old Earl to plead for him not to evict the Higgins family, who are behind in their rent. Cedric, overhearing their tale of sicknesses, financial woes and family devotion, exclaims, \"That's like Michael!\" \"I forgot we had a philanthropist here,\" says the amused old Earl and dictates a letter for Cedric to write and sign. The Dorincourt tenant manager is thus directed to let Tom Higgins and family stay on. \"I hope when I grow up I shall be just like you!\" says Cedric.The delighted minister leaves to deliver the good news to the Higginses, then, the old Earl tempts Cedric to skip his daily visit to his mother to see a surprise - a new pony in the stables. \"Whose pony is it?\" asks young Cedric eagerly. \"Yours\" says the Earl, but Cedric will not stay and miss his daily visit with his beloved mother. Cedric is bewildered when the Earl will not get out to say hello to \"Dearest,\" his mother. As the earl's carriage drives away, he sees Cedric run to his dear mother's arms.As the villagers and tenants go to church the next day, they talk about the wonderful new Lord Fauntleroy and his charming American mother. They greet his mother who, with Mary, walks into church. When they see Cedric arrive (with, unbelievably, the Earl), one declares of Fauntleroy, \"He's Captain Cedric all over again!\" Cedric marvels at the smiles of the people and assumes it's because they love his grandfather, which the Earl corrects, saying they're bowing to him, Lord Fauntleroy. \"To me?\" This surprises Cedric and endears him to the people.In the church service, Cedric sees an inscription on a tomb: \"Here lyeth ye bodye of Gregorye Arthvre Fyrst Earle of Dorincovrt Allsoe of Allsone Hildecarde hys wyfe.\" Cedric whispers to his grandfather \"Who are they?\" and the old Earl replies, \"They are some of your ancestors, lived a few hundred years ago.\" Cedric figures he inherited his bad spelling from them.After church, tenant Tom Higgins thanks Cedric for interceding for him, but Cedric turns all praise towards his grandfather. The Earl takes this opportunity to sourly say that Cedric has the right idea about his true character and everyone should turn to him (Cedric) for the right idea. Higgins, a bit confused, smiles as he understands.In the carriage ride back to the castle, the subject of Cedric missing his mom comes up. Seeing her everyday isn't like seeing her all the time, and he must now wait to tell her things. To explain it further, if Cedric were now to be separated from his grandfather, he would think of his grandfather all the more. \"On my word,\" says the Earl, \"I believe you would.\"Later Cedric writes Mr. Hobbs, \"He is such a good Earl, he reminds me of you. He is a universal favorite!\"Back in Brooklyn, NY, at Hobb's Finer Groceries, Mr. Hobbs and street urchin Dick Tipton mutually miss Cedric and read his letter aloud. Mr. Hobbs still thinks earls are haughty and mean and laments that Cedric \"would have been a shining light in the grocery business.\"When he learns Dick has no safe place to sleep, Mr. Hobbs offers the lad the sleeping space in his loft for free. \"Gee, Mr. Hobbs, talkin' about earls, you ain't no earl. You're a prince!\" exclaims the grateful young bootblack.At Dorincourt Castle, the Earl throws a lavish party to introduce Cedric, the new Lord Fauntleroy, to society. The Earl's younger sister, Lady Constantia (Constance Collier), and her husband Sir Harry Lorridaile (E. E. Clive) are delighted to meet their grand-nephew Cedric. She tells Cedric \"I loved your father more than most people in this wicked world,\" to which Cedric replies that she must therefore meet and talk to Dearest about him. Cedric is a hit with the guests, and more than one guest comments on the profound change the boy's presence has wrought upon his grandfather; however, the old Earl notices that Mr. Havisham is grim. Mr. Havisham has news but begs off sharing it till later.After the party, Mr. Havisham tells the Earl bad news, the worst: the male offspring of his oldest son, Bevis, has come forth and is apparently the rightful heir, making Cedric the mere offspring of the Earl's younger son, Capt. Errol. The old Earl is immediately angry - \"It's a lie!\" - then becomes slowly ashamed. He asks, \"The woman, you say, is an ignorant, vulgar person?\" \"She can hardly spell her own name. She's obviously uneducated and openly mercenary,\" says the lawyer. The Earl looks warmly down upon sleeping young Cedric. \"And I ... I objected to HIS mother. I suppose it's retribution,\" he says repentantly. A servant enters and the Earl distinctly instructs him to take \"Lord Fauntleroy\" up to his room.News of the turn of events goes public. Even the Earl's sister and brother-in-law feel sorry for the old boy, declaring Cedric a thoroughbred if ever there was one and the first human being the Earl has ever loved.Villagers talk at the inn where Minna, former wife of Bevis (the Earl's deceased eldest son), is staying. Knowing the great change grandson Cedric worked on the old Earl, they discuss how hard this new claimant is upon his Lordship, and Cedric losing his title will mean the loss of the best friend the community ever had.The old Earl and Mr. Havisham meet Minna, now going by \"Lady Fauntleroy\" (Helen Flint), her lawyer Mr. Joshua Snade (Walter Kingsford), and her dirty-faced, candy-sucking son Bevis (Jackie Searl) at the inn. Her initial pretense of charm dies swiftly under the Earl's glower, as does Bevis' courage in meeting his grandfather. She confronts the old Earl, hoping to get plenty of money as her son sucks away at his lollipop and stares dumbly.\"Your son Bevis married me all right, and a fine rotter he was, but he was the father of my boy.... I've heard plenty about you and your dirty, snobbish pride. Plenty of pride YOU'LL have when I'M finished with you!... unless you wanna climb down off your high horse and get reasonable...\" she smirks. The old Earl, in disgust, promises that the lawful heir will get his due but forbids her to enter Dorincourt till after his death. \"Yes, you're exactly the kind of person that I should've expected my son Bevis to choose.\" The Earl exits and Minna laughs maniacally.Several lawyers find no fault in Minna's paperwork. \"That's monstrous!\" cried the Earl. \"That mother and that boy are utterly unfit!\" he continues. \"Perhaps,\" says the lawyer, \"the boy won't turn out so badly as you fear.\" \"That boy?!\" snaps the Earl. \"That...OAF?!!\"The old Earl, grieved again at how he objected to Cedric's mother, calls on her and asks her forgiveness. She comforts the stricken Earl.The Earl enters Ceddie's room, and the boy can immediately tell it's bad news: He's not Lord Fauntleroy anymore. He's asks if the other boy will now be the Earl's boy, like he himself was. \"NO!\" growls the Earl strongly. Cedric can and will still be his grandfather's boy, even if he's not going to be the earl.Back in Brooklyn, Mr. Hobbs gets a shoeshine at Dick Tipton's fancy new shoeshine stand that Cedric had given him. Mr. Hobbs reads aloud a news story about the new Lord Fauntleroy and Dick looks at the picture of the new Lady Fauntleroy on page five. \"Holy mackerel!\" exclaims Dick, \"That's Minna, Ben's [former] wife!\" They suspect fraud and go off to seek proper advice.Later, at the inn near Dorincourt, Minna and lawyer Joshua Snade, confined in the small quarters, snap at each other. She wishes to go but doesn't want to leave the area till the Earl settles money on her. Suddenly the dour Earl enters, followed shortly by Dick (grinning), his older brother Ben (scowling), Mr. Havisham (stern) and Mr. Hobbs (interested). \"Where's the child?\" asks Ben, \"...our boy Tom.\" Minna launches into a feigned sad tale of Tom dying three days after his birth from pneumonia. Dick notices movement at a door across the room and opens it, revealing Ben's son Tom, a.k.a. Bevis. \"Hello, Uncle Dick,\" says the boy, and the fraud is exposed.As Minna quickly accuses them of spying on her and trying to do her hurt, Ben calls Tom over, and father and son are happily reunited. Joshua claims he knew nothing of the deception, but Havisham points out the \"little matter of a forged birth certificate.\" Sick of the whole matter, the Earl declares he's had enough, and the sooner the pair of them leave the country the better. He exits the room, followed by all members of his party.Time to celebrate Cedric's 10th birthday, and Cedric fills in an engraved invitation for his birthday party to Silas Hobbs personally.The Earl shows Mr. Hobbs around Dorincourt Castle's portrait hall. They view the Earl's earlier distinguished ancestors (which Hobbs mistakes him as saying \"aunt's sisters\" - \"Your Great Uncle, he MUST have had a family!\"). Mr. Hobbs concedes \"You know, Earl... you're a pretty good sort, even if you are an earl.\" \"I'm very gratified\" says the Earl. \"You know,\" continues Mr. Hobbs, \"I wouldn't have minded being one myself.\" The Earl grunts his amusement at that.Outside, the gathered townspeople, tenants and American visitors (Mr. Hobbs and Dick Tipton) cheer on Cedric for a speech, which is short and graciously thankful for their attendance. \"Ain't he a daisy?\" says Dick, \"I bet you boids [birds] elect him king some day.\" \"I didn't know the little fellow could talk so good!\" says Mr. Hobbs.The Earl has another birthday present for the delighted Cedric - his mother, who's come to live with them in the castle. \"To Live with us?\" asks Cedric excitedly, \"To live with us for always?\" \"We've always wanted (her),\" admits the Earl, \"but we weren't exactly aware of it.\"Mrs. Errol is glad to see her old friend, Mr. Hobbs, and says, \"I dread to think of you ever going back to America.\" The new Anglophile American Silas Hobbs says \"Not to live there. Not to live there. America's a good enough country for them that's young and stern, but there's faults in it. There's not an aunt's sister among 'em - NOR an earl.\"The End."

        "sinopsis": "First we see a dictionary page highlighting SABOTAGE, then a power station with one chimney smoking in the moonlight, then a gaudily lit London street at night. The lights in the streets go out. Lit only by flashlight, we see a large machine half in water. Several hands excitedly fuss with the machinery, digging up a muddy substance. A first voice says: \"Sand!\", then another voice \"Sabotage!\", and a third : \"Who did it?\" The face of Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka), walking in the shadows, emerges to fill the screen.Customers at the BIJOU cinema exit to the street after the power goes off. Some loudly insist on getting a refund. At the box office, the clerk and the owner's wife are hesitant to refund anything, as they are short of cash.A youngish man Ted Spencer (John Loder) stands on a step and spouts off comically as though he knows the law and repeats there is no need to return money, as there is no fault by the cinemas owners.Meanwhile, Verloc comes into the BIJOU surreptitiously although Ted observes him. He quietly goes to bed at the dwelling in back of the screen and lies down as if he had been napping.Verloc's young wife Sylvia (Sylvia Sidney) is hesitant to give refunds, and believes her husband is still out, but Ted tells her he saw him come in, so she goes into the apartment, finds Verloc, and asks whether to refund the money. Verloc tells her to go ahead and give refunds, as he will be getting some money shortly.Just as refunds are about to be given, the power comes back on, customers laugh and reenter the BIJOU.The Verlocs are the owners of the BIJOU. They live, together with her little brother Stevie (Desmond Tester), in the rear apartment. Right after the blackout, the cook leaves, leaving Stevie in charge of finalizing dinner. Stevie fumbles and breaks a dish, which he hides in a drawer.Scotland Yard suspects Verloc is an agent for a foreign power, part of a gang planning other attacks. Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer was assigned to investigate Verloc under cover, and attempt to get hard evidence against him. Spencer poses as a greengrocer's helper, selling fruit and vegetables in a shop right next to the cinema. The family comes into the shop often, and he ingratiates himself with Stevie and his sister by providing many extra services.Ted is attracted to the beautiful Sylvia but she wants nothing to do with his advances.Ted invites Stevie and Sylvia to a full lunch at Simpson's, a fashionable restaurant. At the lunch, Sylvia explains that her husband is a good man who has been kind to her and her little brother.She is an American who came to London with Stevie to escape the Depression in America, but when the economy crashed in England, too, they were down on their luck and to survive she married a kind older man who protected them. They are running the BIJOU, but struggling economically.Verloc receives a phone call and goes to the London aquarium to receive pay and more instructions. He is tailed by police, who want to identify the entire saboteur gang, but knowing the foreign bosses are \"people you and I will never catch\" as one policeman tells another.Verloc meets his contact in front of an illuminated tank where a huge turtle is swimming. A passerby (Charles Hawtrey) enthusiastically describes the reproduction of fish at the aquarium and compares them to humans.Verloc is paid but scolded because his power station stunt was disappointing. \"London must not laugh\" is the order given to Verloc. \"We want the English to worry about what happens in England and thus pay no attention to what happens elsewhere in Europe\". Agents must not fear retribution to earn their money.Then the contact assigns Verloc to put a bomb in Piccadilly Circus station \"the center of the world\", and produce fear, not laughter. Verloc isn't a forceful villain, just a weak, man of no moral fiber who objects to the idea of murder but decides to go through with it for money.The bomb is to be prepared by an agent who runs a pet shop as a front. Verloc realizes that he is in over his head, and tries to get out of the fearsome responsibilities, but he is scolded again and he accepts.\nIn a dreamy sequence the scared Verloc sees the fish swimming in the tank and imagines them as motor cars filled with passengers moving around Piccadilly Circus when an explosion demolishes all buildings around. Suddenly the fish in the tank reappear.Again tailed by Scotland Yard, he proceeds to the pet shop. At the pet shop, an old biddy wants to return a canary that won't sing. The shop owner Professor Chatman (William Dewhurst), has no trouble getting the bird to warble, implying that it's the lady's fault. Verloc is led to a stuffy kitchen where a chaotic nconventional family of three, a father, daughter, and granddaughter live, to talk to Chatman.Chatman opens a cabinet, reaching for bomb making stuff and first finds the granddaughter's doll in the cabinet. He then explains to Verloc that the bomb is up to Chatman, only the delivery will be up to Verloc.They agree to disguise the bomb in a cage with canaries, addressed to Stevie, who will enjoy the birds.A clandestine meeting for gang members is arranged for Verloc's apartment. Ted has no difficulty identifying something is afoot, since anyone wanting to see Verloc must walk up to the front of the Bijou, pass into the dark screening room, walk along its side to a curtain next to the screen. Behind the curtain is Verloc's door.Ted gets Stevie to show him how to get behind the screen to a window from which he might overhear what is going on at the meeting Verloc is having with other shifty-eyed foreigners in ill-fitting suits. Unfortunately, he is spotted by the conspirators and pulled into the room.The conspirators end their meeting, telling Verloc the job is his alone. Verloc exits to talk to his neighbor the greengrocer, and elicits comments that confirm that Ted is a policeman under cover.Meantime Sylvia has become gradually more suspicious about Verloc's activities. However, she hesitates and delays.Professor Chatman sends Stevie a pair of canaries in a cage, with the package bomb concealed in a drawer underneath. Verloc reads a sealed message that the bomb is set to go off at 1:45. Ted admits he is a detective and detains Verloc asking him details over and over, pretending he has no suspicions of Verloc himself. Verloc, wanting an alibi for the time of the explosion, arranges for Stevie to take the package to Picadilly and leave it in the station cloakroom by 1:30. The excuse is that a film canister needs to be returned nearby. It must be walked over, because it is inflammable and it cant be carried on a bus.The heartbreakingly cheerful brother is carrying the bomb along with film canisters labeled \"Bartholomew the Strangler. Because the Lord Mayor's parade is on that day, Stevie is delayed by all manner of events. A street vendor pulls him out of a crowd in order to demonstrate a new toothpaste. He's stopped from crossing a street because the parade is marching by. He enjoys watching the parade. The parade has snarled traffic. When he gets on a bus the conductor ironically warns, \"Don't set fire to me or the other passengers.\" The bus keeps hitting red lights.There are many cuts between the oblivious Stevie, with a time bomb in a package under one arm while petting a fluffy puppy with his free hand and talking to an old lady, those big outdoor clocks whose arms get ever closer to 1:45, until the explosion.Ted receives orders to go to the explosion scene. When Stevie does not get back home for a meal, Sylvia starts to worry and ask questions, and learns the awful truth from Verloc.Verloc confesses his part in the sabotage, while standing near the model boat which she and her brother had made, then blames Spencer for Stevie's death, saying he prevented Verloc from delivering the bomb himself. Verloc suggests to Sylvia that they could have a child of their own, as if to compensate for her loss.Sylvia, deeply depressed and confused at the revelation, hears laughter from the audience. She wanders into the theater in shock, and sits to watch \"Who Killed Cock Robin,\" a 1935 Disney cartoon featuring a parody of Mae West. Momentarily, she laughs, but when the arrow is loosed and slays poor Cock Robin, the laughter on her face changes to an expression of agony and terror.Her eyes and expressions subtly convey an emotional cascade of stunned realization, immense sadness, and suppressed hysteria. She realizes what a monster her husband is.Sylvia explodes after sitting to dinner with Verloc. He orders his still shocked and dazed wife to a \"get a grip\" and get prepared to deny everything. He goes on to order her to scold the cook about the overcooked cabbage soup on the dinner table.Without dialogue, the camera shifts from her face, to Verloc's, to the food they are eating, to her hold on a carving knife, until they both rise, stare at each other, and it happens: she stabs him in the stomach with the knife.Meantime, Ted discovers, at the scene of the blown up bus, part of the film canister from the BIJOU that most likely was carried by Stevie, so he returns to the BIJOU.We see Sylvia sitting, dazed, right past the doorway, and in the foreground, the feet of the slain Verloc.When Spencer arrives at the apartment, he realizes what has happened, but insists that Sylvia shouldn't admit that she knifed her husband. He takes her out of the apartment and tries to convince her that he is in love with her, and talks about getting on a boat crossing the Channel to France and together escape the police.Professor Chatman's daughter berates him for leaving a bird-cage with the shop's identification at Verloc's, and insists he go back to retrieve it. Chatman enters the apartment just ahead of a squad of detectives coming for Verloc. When the detectives knock, he locks the door and announces he has a bomb and will blow it up if they enter.The detectives at the door assume they are hearing Verlocs voice, and take the threat seriously. They evacuate the building. They argue about who should stay near the apartment: the single guy says he will stay and let the married ones go to a safer place, but one of the marrieds jokes that since hes already married, his life is over anyway so he might as well stay.Sylvia is dazedly responding to Ted's love declaration, and kisses him, but she refuses to run away, and is just on the edge of confessing to a policeman when an explosion and fire at the cinema intervenes. The evidence of her crime is destroyed, and effectively prevents the policeman from remembering whether it was before or after the explosion that she said, \"My husband is dead!\"At the end we see Sylvia and Ted walk away together."

When lovely blonde Valerie Purvis (Bette Davis) hires Shayne to track down Mme. Barabbas (Alison Skipworth) but doesn't tell him why, Shayne complies and is naturally curious particularly because Purvis pays a lot of money for the detecting job. Barabbas coincidentally wants Shayne to track down Purvis and retrieve an ancient horn that is filled with price-less jewels which she says was stolen from her. Along the way Shayne's apartment and office is ransacked by a dandy Englishman Anthony Travers (Arthur Treacher) who informs the detective that Purvis is not to be trusted. When Purvis sends a message for Shayne to meet her, Ames goes instead and is shot dead by the dangerous femme. Purvis asks Shayne to pick up a package from a ship from Asia, but when Shayne arrives the ship is burning, and the wounded Captain arrives to deliver the legendary gem-filled horn everyone is chasing. With the horn in his possession Shayne arranges it so that all the main culprits convene on the docks with the Police present to make an arrest, but the detective has one final thing to do to insure that the killer of his partner doesn't go free and he corners Purvis at his apartment to get to the bottom of things."

        "sinopsis": "It is 1916 after the beginning of the First World War, in London. A somber group is filing past a casket surrounded by candles. The butler sees everyone out, locks the door, then takes down the casket, which is empty. Next we are at a British intelligence office in the middle of an air raid, and an officer in uniform comes in, holding a newspaper that seems to announce his own death. The officer, a writer by profession, (John Gielgud), is given false passports with the name Ashenden, introduced to an assistant (Peter Lorre) who goes by the nickname General, and told to proceed in disguise to Switzerland, Hotel Excelsior, and await further instructions. The instructions are to identify a German undercover agent who is at the hotel and about to leave Switzerland for Istanbul, then to prevent the German agent from reaching his destination by any means necessary. In Switzerland we see an old man buy a bar of chocolate, open it, and read a hidden message that a British spy is expected to arrive at the hotel Excelsior. Ashenden checks into the hotel and learns that Mrs. Ashenden (Madeleine Carroll) had arrived the day before. He goes to the rooms reserved for the couple and finds Mrs. Ashenden in conversation with an American, Mr. Marvin (Robert Young), who has been insinuating himself to her. The fake Ashenden couple have their initial conversations to get acquainted, and the General comes in also. Ashenden and the General go to the church to meet the organist, a supposed double agent, to get more information, but they find the organist dead at the organ, with a special type of button in his fist. Back at the hotel they strike up a conversation with a British tourist, they all go to the casino together, and are surprised when the torn button appears to come from the British tourist's coat sleeve, supposedly identifying the tourist as the killer of the organist. The group, including Marvin, have dinner at the same table, and meet the wife of the tourist, who is German and says this trip is the first time she has ever been out of Germany. Ashenden and the General make bets about which of them is a better mountain hiker. They convince the British tourist to go up a nearby mountain the next day, where they plan to murder him. Ashenden has misgivings in participating in a murder, and tries to turn back from the climb, but the General continues up the mountain and pushes the tourist off a cliff. Back at the hotel they receive word that they have identified the wrong man and thus murdered an innocent Briton. This causes consternation and conflict between the Ashendens, he taking the view that he was on an assignment in wartime, she that the murder of an innocent is too high a price to pay even in wartime. This moral conflict is a continuing source of much anguish for both of them, who are otherwise much attracted to each other.Meantime, the General has snooped around and found that the chocolate factory is a center for spy messages, and talks Ashenden into going there to try to get more information from the boyfriend of one of the hotel maids, who has a job at the factory. Mrs. Ashenden decides she wants to resign from her spying assignment and separate herself from her fake husband, and, having no special place to go, she decides to go with Marvin on the next leg of his train trip. At the chocolate factory Ashenden and the General are fingered as British spies and the police is called. They stage an emergency and pull a fire alarm to create chaos, and succeed in evading the police and returning to the hotel, where they find Mrs. Ashenden gone (accompanying Marvin) and also get a coded telegram that identifies Marvin as the agent. They manage to get to the train station, warn Mrs. Ashenden that Marvin is their target, and she agrees to resume her spy duties by pretending to be romantically interested in Marvin. They get on a train that eventually crosses into neutral territory and then into another country at war against Britain. As they confront Marvin in a compartment and he admits being a German agent, British planes attack the train, producing a train wreck. Marvin is mortally wounded, the General is shot dead, and Mr. and Mrs. Ashenden, now in love with each other, are able to return to England without having had to physically murder anyone. A brief epilogue follows, showing the triumph of British forces in the Eastern (Turkish) front."

        "summary": "Despite her mother's objections, the naive young daughter of a show boat captain is thrust into the limelight as the company's new leading lady.",
        "sinopsis": "This film of \"Show Boat\" is more faithful to the original stage musical than any of the other films of it, except for the 1989 videotaped production presented on PBS.As the film begins, the Cotton Palace, a show boat on the Mississippi River, pulls into port. On board are the owner Cap'n Andy Hawks, his nagging, disapproving wife Parthy, and their eighteen-year old daughter Magnolia, along with their troupe of actors, singers, and dancers. Pete, the rough, coarse engineer of the towboat Mollie Able, which pushes the Cotton Palace, notices Queenie, the show boat's African-American cook, wearing a brooch that he had sent to the Cotton Palace's leading lady, Julie la Verne, in the hopes of seducing her away from her husband, Steve Baker, leading man of the company. Julie wants nothing to do with Pete and has given Queenie the brooch. Pete threatens Julie in front of her husband. A fistfight breaks out between Steve and Pete on the levee, just as Cap'n Andy is introducing his actors to the assembled crowd. Andy quickly pretends that Steve and Pete were merely acting out a scene from one of the plays performed by the company. Windy McLain, the pilot of the Mollie Able, notices that Pete has stolen Julie's photo out of its frame on the levee, where photos of the acting troupe are posted. The angry Parthy warns Julie to stay away from Magnolia, whom Julie loves as if she were a younger sister. Sadly, Julie tells Cap'n Andy that if she cannot see Magnolia, she cannot stay on the boat, but she does not resign or leave.After everyone exits, riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal passes by and sees Magnolia on the upper deck of the show boat. The two are instantly romantically attracted to each other. However, Ravenal must shortly leave to speak to the town judge about a personal matter.Later that day, the company is rehearsing the play they are to perform that night, when they are alerted by Ellie, the comedienne of the boat, that Pete is returning with the Sheriff. Windy also warns them that Pete has stolen Julie's picture and is up to something. Instantly, Steve, Julie's husband, takes out a menacing switchblade knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood. The Sheriff enters and announces that Julie is a half-black woman married to a white man, which is illegal. Steve, who is the white man, says that he is also part-black. Because he has sucked in some of Julie's blood, the troupe, especially Windy, a boyhood friend of the Sheriff's, backs Steve up, preventing the Sheriff from arresting Steve and Julie. But the couple, now that Julie's mixed blood has been revealed, can no longer act with the rest of the company, so they must leave. At this, Gaylord Ravenal, who also has been ordered to leave town, reappears and asks for passage on the boat. Cap'n Andy, realizing the handsome Ravenal's potential as an actor, hires him as leading man, and over Parthy's objections, makes Magnolia the new leading lady. Magnolia tearfully says goodbye to Julie, who sadly leaves with her husband, but not before hearing Cap'n Andy make Magnolia the new leading lady and Ravenal the new leading man. Pete is fired offscreen.Weeks pass, and by now, Magnolia and Ravenal have fallen in love. Parthy is determined to get the goods on Ravenal, and temporarily leaves town. While she is gone, Ravenal proposes to Magnolia and the two make plans to marry. Just as they are about to enter the church, Parthy returns and announces that Ravenal killed a man years ago - this is why he can never stay in town for very long - but the Sheriff says that it was self-defense, so Parthy is powerless to do anything. Magnolia and Ravenal are married.More time passes, and the happy couple has a baby daughter, whom they name Kim. They leave the boat and go to live in Chicago, where they are alternately rich and broke, depending on Ravenal's luck at gambling (he does not work). One day, while they are living in a second rate boarding house, Magnolia runs into Ellie and her husband Frank Shultz, who have left the show boat and have been booked into the Trocadero, a Chicago nightclub. Then someone brings a letter, which turns out to be a farewell note from Ravenal, who has decided to leave Magnolia out of guilt for his inability to support her. Frank and Ellie take the devastated Magnolia to the Trocadero, where Magnolia hopes to find a job. But she does not know that the featured singer is Julie, the same Julie from the show boat, who has become an alcoholic now that Steve has left her. From her dressing room, Julie overhears Magnolia audition, and realizing that she needs the job, abruptly quits so that the manager will have no choice but to hire Magnolia, who never learns of Julie's generous sacrifice, or even that she once worked there.On New Year's Eve, Cap'n Andy and Parthy arrive in Chicago for a surprise visit, but are unable to find Magnolia and Ravenal because they are no longer living in a fancy hotel. Andy decides to go celebrate New Year's Eve alone and ends up (a little tipsy) at the Trocadero, where he discovers Magnolia singing. When she falters due to stage fright, he encourages her and she becomes a hit and goes on to a successful international career. She raises her daughter all alone.More time passes and we see Ravenal's hands pasting newspaper clippings about Magnolia into a scrapbook. He is either living or staying in another second-rate boarding house. It is now about thirty years later. Magnolia, now about sixty, is retiring from the stage. Her daughter Kim has become a musical star and is about to play her first leading role on Broadway. She does not realize that the shabbily dressed theatre doorman, whom she knows only as \"Pop\", is in reality her own father, Gaylord Ravenal. He is fired for trying to watch the performance just as Magnolia, Cap'n Andy, and Parthy arrive (they have come all the way from Mississippi to see Kim's starring debut). Magnolia sees Ravenal and invites him to sit with them, and the theatre manager, who has learned the truth, allows him to do so. After the show ends, Kim asks her mother to sing an encore. Ravenal joins her in song, Kim is moved to tears, and Magnolia and Ravenal are reconciled."

        "summary": "A black British dockworker named Johnny Zinga becomes a famous singer and learns that he is the rightful king of the African island of Casanga.",
        "sinopsis": "On the island of Casanga off the west coast of Africa in 1700, the people suffer oppression from cruel Queen Zinga [Cornelia Smith]. In a jungle ceremony a man who has tried to overthrow Zinga has been tied up. She tells him he can be king for one minute before he dies and places a large medallion around his neck. A young girl runs to Zinga to try and stop the ceremony but as she is pushed away she grabs the medallion and runs into the jungle with Zinga's son, chased by several men armed with spears. After a long chase, the couple reach the coast and make their escape to the mainland in a boat. On the mainland they meet some slave traders and ask to be taken with them, so they are put on the boat to England.Over the years the medallion is passed down through the generations and eventually becomes the property of Johnny Zinga [Paul Robeson], a dock worker in London in 1936 who possesses an outstanding singing voice.Italian opera producer Gabriel Donozetti [Esme Percy] arrives in London and overhears Johnny's singing as he passes in his car. Donozetti thinks a singer with a voice that good could be a star but loses sight of Johnny in the crowds.In a pub with his co-workers, Johnny meets man who is sailing for Africa the next day. Later at home with his wife Ruth [Elisabeth Welch] he pines for Africa and wishes he could go there to his roots. Despite having a happy life in London, Johnny feels a part of him belongs in Africa.Donozetti wants to find the singer he overheard so he and his pianist Blane [Ronald Simpson] go to the docks to search for him. They are directed to a nearby pub where Johnny is singing. Donozetti offers him a career as a singer and asks him and Ruth to come to his hotel the following day.In his hotel room Donozetti starts to teach Johnny to sing but Johnny does not like being told what to do and becomes angry. However, when Donozetti and Ruth convince him he can become rich and travel, Johnny sees his opportunity and agrees to continue with the training. He becomes a successful professional singer.At the end of one show he is supposed to make a speech but sings a song solo about freedom instead. One of the audience members, Sir James Pyrie [Bernard Ansell] comes back stage after the show to meet Johnny. Pyrie explains he is an explorer and anthropologist and asks Johnny where the song is from as it stirs memories in him. Johnny explains he was born in London and does not know but shows Pyrie the medallion he always wears. Pyrie then remembers he heard the song in Casanga and tells Johnny the story about Zinga's son running away and that Johnny could be a direct royal descendant and king of Casanga. Donozetti wants Johnny to go to New York but in light of this news, Johnny wants to go back to his people in Casanga.Johnny and Ruth travel to Casanga with Johnny's valet Monty [Robert Adams]. Johnny tells the Casanga natives he is Zinga their king and shows them the medallion. They are not impressed but take him to their village. Everything is very primitive in the village but Johnny and Ruth are determined to help. Johnny sees sick people in one hut and tries to help with medicines they have brought with them but is unsuccessful. Johnny tells one of the more accepting natives, Mandingo [Ecce Homo Toto], how he can help but Mandingo warns him about going against their customs and how he will never be accepted as king. The natives believe in ancient rituals and superstitions which Johnny tries to stop. He argues with the native leader and witch doctor [James Solomon] about their respective beliefs. That night Johnny agrees to attend another one of the rituals, to the concern of Ruth and Monty who think it may be a trap, but Johnny says he will respect their customs this time. However, when Ruth arrives, Johnny and Ruth are tied up and incarcerated since it is forbidden for a woman to view the ritual.The next day Ruth is taken for execution and Johnny is forcibly taken to witness the natives' justice. The witch doctor forces Johnny to sit in the king's seat and tells him their ancient laws must be obeyed. Will he sentence Ruth to death as their true king should? Instead, Johnny starts to sing the song of freedom which the natives believe no outsider would have heard, proving he is descended from the same people as them. Ruth is released and they are finally accepted.Once a year, Johnny returns to London from Casanga to sing publicly in Donozetti's shows to raise money for his people."

        "summary": "The biography of the pioneering French microbiologist who helped revolutionize agriculture and medicine.",
        "sinopsis": "In Paris in 1860, a distraught man murders his wife's doctor. Chemist Louis Pasteur has been publicizing a theory that diseases are caused by microbes, which doctors should avoid spreading by washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments in boiling water. The doctor did not do this and the wife died of puerperal fever after giving birth.Pasteur is dismissed by France's medical academy-particularly his most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet-as a crank whose recommendations are tantamount to witchcraft. Pasteur frankly calls attention to the risks of Charbonnet's non-sterile methods and correctly predicts that a member of Napoleon III's royal family who Charbonnet is attending will die of puerperal fever, but Pasteur is the one who is considered dangerous, because his ideas have led to murder. When the Emperor comes down against him, Pasteur leaves Paris and moves to the small town of Arbois.In the 1870s, when the new French government tries to restore the economy after the Franco-Prussian War, they learn that many sheep are dying of anthrax, except around Arbois. They send representatives who learn that, working with a small group of loyal researchers, Pasteur has developed a vaccine against the disease and put it into use locally.The medical academy still opposes him and says Arbois must simply be free of anthrax, so the government buys land there and invites sheep farmers to use it. Pasteur objects strongly, saying the soil is full of anthrax spores, and eventually an experiment is proposed. He will vaccinate 25 of the newly arrived sheep; then they and a control group of 25 others will be injected with blood from a sheep with anthrax.Joseph Lister, the pioneer of antiseptic surgery in England, is interested enough to attend, and witnesses Pasteur's total success as all the vaccinated sheep remain healthy after the other 25 have died. At this point Jean Martel, a young doctor who was formerly Charbonnet's assistant but now is a follower of Pasteur, becomes engaged to Pasteur's daughter Annette.The celebrations are short-lived, as a rabid dog runs through the town and a man is bitten. As a woman attempts to cure him by witchcraft, Pasteur laments that doctors would have no more chance of success. Moving back to Paris, he makes rabies his next project. He is able to spread the disease from one animal to another by injection, but finds himself unable to detect any microbe being transferred (viruses had not yet been discovered), and the method he used to create the anthrax vaccine does not work.Charbonnet visits the lab to gloat over Pasteur's failure. He is so certain Pasteur is a quack that he injects himself with rabies-and is triumphant, as he does not get the disease. Pasteur is puzzled, until his wife Marie suggests that the sample may have gotten weak with age. This sets him on the right path at last, giving dogs a series of progressively stronger injections.But before his experiments reach a conclusion, a frantic mother begs him to try his untested treatment on her son, who has been bitten by a rabid dog. Risking imprisonment or even execution, Pasteur decides he must try to save the child. During the attempt, a Dr. Zaranoff arrives from Russia with a group of peasants who have been exposed to rabies, and who have volunteered to receive Pasteur's treatment.Annette goes into labor with Martel's child. The doctor who was to attend her is unavailable, and Martel is urgently needed for the boy. Pasteur searches frantically for another doctor, but the only one he can find is none other than Charbonnet. He begs Charbonnet to wash his hands and sterilize his instruments just this once; Charbonnet finally agrees on condition that if Charbonnet lives another month, Pasteur will retract and denounce all his work on rabies. Both men are honorable enough to respect the agreement. The birth goes well, but Pasteur collapses with a mild stroke.Days later, word comes that Pasteur has permission to treat those of the Russians who are still alive. He attends them in hospital for the first injections using a wheelchair, and later using a cane. The experiment is a success, and now even Charbonnet concedes that he was wrong, tearing up Pasteur's retraction and asking for the shots for himself.Afterwards, Pasteur hears that he is to be denounced by Lister at the medical academy. He angrily attends, but it was just a way to surprise him. He is praised by Lister, presented with a Russian medal by Zaranoff, and honored by the very doctors who once scoffed at his discoveries."

        "sinopsis": "Already late for his hometown wedding, featured troupe dancer and professional gambler John \"Lucky\" Garnett is delayed further when his fellow dancers, who want to keep him single and in show business, convince him that the cuffless trousers of his morning suit are out of style and need tailoring. By the time Lucky arrives at his fiance Margaret Watson's home, her infuriated father, Judge Watson, has called off the wedding. Once calm, Watson tells Lucky that, if he wants a second chance with Margaret, he must earn at least $25,000 in New York City. Determined to make good, Lucky accepts Watson's challenge and with his friend, magician Everett \"Pop\" Cardetti, and his lucky quarter, hops a train to the city. Shortly after they arrive, Lucky, broke but still in his wedding clothes, asks a pretty stranger, Penelope \"Penny\" Carrol, for change for his lucky quarter so that Pop can buy a pack of vending machine cigarettes. When the machine gives them a flood of unexpected change, Lucky chases after Penny to ask for his quarter back, but she mistakes his eagerness for mashing and refuses his request. After Pop pickpockets the quarter from Penny's purse, Penny accuses Lucky of theft and calls a policeman. To Penny's dismay, the policeman sides with the well-dressed Lucky, and Penny leaves in a huff for her job as an instructor at the Gordon Dancing Academy. Lucky follows Penny into the Academy and poses as an ardent but awkward pupil. Frustrated by Lucky's seemingly hopeless dancing, a still angry Penny insults him in front of Gordon, the Academy's fussy owner, and is fired. To save Penny's job, Lucky insists on demonstrating for Gordon what he has just learned from Penny and executes a complex routine with her. Impressed by the duet, Gordon arranges for Penny and Lucky to audition at the Silver Sandal nightclub but stipulates that Lucky wear a tuxedo in the act. Still broke, Lucky and Pop check into the same hotel as Penny and her older single friend, Mabel Anderson, and try to win a tuxedo from a drunk gambler on the night of the audition. When Penny discovers a half-dressed Lucky playing piquet in his room, she storms away in another huff. A week later, Lucky, who with Pop's help has won hundreds of dollars gambling and has arranged for another audition, finally convinces Penny of his sincerity. However, at the club audition, bandleader Ricardo \"Ricky\" Romero, who is in love with Penny, jealousy refuses to play for the couple. Lucky then learns that Ricky's contract has been won by Raymond, a casino owner, and with Pop's sleight-of-hand help, wins Ricky's contract for himself. Against his wishes, Ricky plays for Penny and Lucky's triumphant audition, but the dancers' budding romance is stifled when Lucky suddenly remembers his pledge to Margaret. Although he has vowed to stop gambling and has insisted on a modest salary in order to avoid earning the now dreaded $25,000, Lucky instructs Pop to keep him away from the tempting Penny. When Pop reveals to a perplexed Penny the reason behind Lucky's aloofness, Penny again snubs her partner and, in spite of her love for him, returns to Ricky. After Lucky and Penny's grand performance at the Silver Sandal's re-opening, Lucky is surprised by the appearance of Margaret and then is confronted by Raymond, who accuses Pop of cheating him out of Ricky's contract. Raymond demands that the game be re-played with his pack of marked cards, and wins back the contract, after which Penny tells Lucky that she and Ricky are engaged. Thoroughly depressed, Lucky prepares to tell Margaret that he no longer loves her, but she surprises him by revealing that she, too, has fallen in love with someone else. Minutes before Penny is to marry Ricky, Madge tells her about Lucky's broken engagement, while Lucky and Pop conspire to thwart the wedding using the cuffed trouser hoax. In the end, Penny calls off the wedding and reunites with Lucky."

Newspaper reels and first pages telling of how the police is tackling the issue of the marijuana war. In one of them, there is an advertisement telling parents to attend Alfred Carroll (Josef Forte)'s lecture at the School-Parents Association in Truman high school auditorium. He mentions that marijuana was grown in a tenement court in New York.Cut to Mae (Thelma White) who is woken up rudely by Pete Daley (Richard Alexander) who wants to lure kids into criminality. Three friends separate. Ralph (Dave O'Brien) points to some attractive young women. The girl Ralph wants most is Jimmy Harper (Warren McCullom)'s sister. Bill (Kenneth Craig) thinks she's interested as well. They go to a jazz place, where Mae sits uncomfortably as she knows that the real objective is to lure kids into drugs. The audience can see Ralph smoking like crazy in a separate room. The say goodbye to Joe (Lester Dorr), the bartender.Mary (Dorothy Short) takes Jimmy home, where Mrs Lane (Mary MacLaren) is happy to see them performing Shakespeare in a ridiculous way. When they kiss, she intervenes. Jimmy says goodbye and falls into a fountain garden. Junior (Bob Burns) laughs about Jimmy having a girlfriend. Ralph and Jimmy go partying. Mae distributes marijuana cigarettes - her husband is delighted that he already has a new kid in the bag: Jimmy. Mary encourages Jimmy to smoke. Ralphs laughs like a maniac: he knows he's succeeded. He goes to see Jack (Carleton Young), who thinks that kids are the best prey - now we would consider young adults, he doesn't mean children. Jimmy drives while high on dope. He scares Jack with his reckless driving and runs over a man.When Jimmy arrives home, it's dinner time. He is shocked, and tired, and his sister notices, but not his mother. Mr Wayne (Edward Earle) thinks that there marijuana is not as dangerous as other drugs, in spite of Mr Carroll's insistence. Jimmy's grades are much worse. Dr Carroll tries to make him confide on him, but Jimmy says that he's worried about a home problem, and just leaves. Mary doesn't play tennis. Jimmy dances at Mae's while he's high. Jimmy makes love to a girl while Ralph laughs like a maniac. The police questions Jimmy's sister if she used her car on the 29th. Mary lies to protect him. Joe gives Mary the address where Jimmy is.

Mary rejects Pete Daley), but Jimmy, completely doped, at first believes that they are making love. When he intervenes, there is a fight between Ralph and Jimmy. In the ensuing fight, the gun which Ralph uses goes off and kills Mary. Ralph dusts the gun off and puts it into Jimmy's hand, who's still doped. When they wake him up, they make him believe that he killed Mary.Jack prepares an alibi for himself. Carroll declares in front to the judge and jury that he's seen Jimmy very much changed, and that marijuana was to blame. The Judge (Edward LeSaint) presides. The jurors (Marin Sais, Phil Dunham) stare at the declarations in shock. Blanche (Lillian Milles) feels sorry for Jimmy, but Jack tells her to shut up. The prosecuting attorney (William Royle) blames marijuana as the cause of the murder. Jimmy is in shock. One of the jurors thinks that Jimmy may have been insane, but the foreman (Frank O'Connor) makes a case for all the opposite: they want to hang Jimmy Harper as soon as possible, even seeing a hanging rope noose in the lightbulb cord. Henry Harper (Edmund Mortimer) isn't able to console his wife. Bill wants to see Jack: he's having strong withdrawal symptoms. He chain smokes. Bill kills Jack. While Mae screams, but Bill's girlfriend laughs like a maniac. The police arrests all the gang. Blanche says that Jimmy didn't kill anybody. It was Jack, and she stayed silent. Instead of going to jail, Blanche commits suicide jumping from a window. The Judge declares Jimmy to be non-guilty. The Harpers hug Jimmy. Ralph is delirious because of marijuana.BACK TO DR CARROLL'S SPEECHHe says that anybody's children may be the next open. He points to the camera (and the audience).The end"

        "sinopsis": "Just before Christmas in the late nineteenth century, Bob Sangster, a cynical renegade, returns to his home town of New Jerusalem to rob the local bank. Accompanying Bob are James \"Doc\" Underwood, a tubercular outcast with the soul of a philosopher, Sam \"Gus\" Bartow, an illiterate drifter, and Pedro, a troubadour. In town, Bob meets Molly, with whom he was once in love, but who now is engaged to banker Frank Benson. Bob offers Molly his mother's watch as a wedding present, but when he accuses her of marrying Frank to forget him, Molly, who had thought that she still loved Bob, angrily returns the watch. Bob then trades the watch for drinks at the bar, but tricks the bartender into returning it by telling him that it was his dead mother's legacy. The next morning, while the townsfolk are busy at a pie sale to raise money for charity, the four outlaws rob the bank. A group of armed citizens pursue them into the desert, and in the exchange of gun fire, Pedro is killed and Doc wounded. In the inferno of the desert, the three come upon a poisoned water hole. On their way to the next water hole, they find the body of a man, and at the now dried-up water hole, they find a half-dead woman and her infant son. The woman, Mrs. George Marshall, tells them that her husband had gone to search for water. Taking pity on the woman, Doc tells her that her husband reached New Jerusalem and sent them to help her. With her dying breath, she begs them to care for her child, but Bob refuses to travel with the baby and resolves to make the eighty-eight mile trek to the next water hole by himself. The next morning, the they discover that their horses have died in the night from drinking poisoned water. Unable to walk the distance to the next water hole, they decide to turn back to New Jerusalem. After combining the last drops of their water, Bob divides up the last three cans of the baby's milk, but Doc offers to buy back Bob's can with his share of the bank loot. Despite his weakened condition, Doc carries the baby until he collapses and is near death. Gus wants to stay with him, but Doc convinces him to continue on with the infant. After writing wills for himself and Gus, Doc bequeaths Gus one of his books and then shoots himself while reciting the words \"out, out, sweet candle\" from Macbeth . Gus and Bob then continue their arduous journey back to New Jerusalem when Gus, half mad with heat and thirst, takes Doc's book and wanders off into the desert. Bob awakens from a short nap to find the note that Doc had written for Gus, pleading with Bob take care of the child. Bob ignores Gus's plea, then picks up the money bags and leaves the baby behind, but when he sees a rattle snake slithering toward the infant, he shoots the snake and returns to give the child the last drop of water. Five-and-a-half miles from his destination, Bob collapses, unable to continue, and prays to God to help the baby. Soon after, Bob sees the poisoned water hole and, realizing that the one hour that it will take the poison to kill him will give him enough time to reach New Jerusalem, he drinks heartily. Bob enters town to the strains of the church congregation singing Christmas hymns and staggers into the church, much to the surprise of the townsfolk. After placing the infant in Molly's arms, Bob collapses and dies. The baby grasps Bob's watch in his fist, and when a member of the congregation wonders where Bob stole it, Molly replies that he did not steal it, the watch belonged to his mother."

        "sinopsis": "Beautiful Marguerite Gautier (Greta Garbo) is a well- known courtesan, living in the demi-monde of mid-19th century Paris. Marguerite's dressmaker and procuress, Prudence Duvernoy (Laura Hope Crews), arranges an assignation at the theatre with a fabulously wealthy prospective patron, the Baron de Varville (Henry Daniell). Marguerite has never met the baron, and she briefly mistakes Armand Duval (Robert Taylor), a handsome young man of good family but no great fortune, for the baron. She finds Armand charming, but when the mistake is explained, she accepts the baron without hesitation.Marguerite spends money carelessly, sometimes out of generosity, as when she bids a fortune on a team of horses in order to give an old coachman employment, but more often because she loves her lavish lifestyle and the late nights of dancing and drinking-and because she knows her days are numbered. She has consumption, which is a death sentence for anyone who lives as she does. She has bouts of severe illness, and during one spell, the only person who came to her door was Armand, bearing flowers (the baron contrived to be in England). She finds this out after she has recovered, and she invites him to her birthday party (the baron has just departed for a long stay in Russia.) During the party, Marguerite retreats into the bedroom with a coughing spell, and Armand follows, He professes his love, which is something she has never known. She gives him a key and tells him to send everyone home and come back later. While she is waiting for him, the baron returns unexpectedly. She orders Nanine to shoot the bolt on the door. The baron, who is clearly suspicious, plays the piano furiously, not quite masking the bell. He asks who might be at the door and, laughing, she says \"The great romance of my life-That might have been.\"At Armand's family home in the country, he asks his father for money to travel, to prepare for his career in the Foreign Service. He sends Marguerite a scathing letter (he saw the baron's carriage) but when she comes to his rooms they reconcile immediately. She sees a miniature of his mother and is amazed to learn that his parents have loved each other for 30 years. \"You'll never love me 30 years,\" she says, sadly. \"I'll love you all my life,\" he replies, and they embrace. Fadeout. Fade in to the two of them on the floor, Armand's head in her lap. He wants to take her to the country for the summer, to get well. She tells him to forget her but agrees in the end. However, she owes 40,000 francs, which must be paid. The baron gives her the money as a parting gift, and slaps her in the face when she kisses him in thanks.Armand takes her to a house in the country; Marguerite thrives on fresh milk and eggs and country walks and love. A shadow is cast by the discovery that the baron's château is in the neighborhood. Marguerite tells him she has asked Prudence to sell everything, pay everything. \"Never doubt that I love you more than the world.\" Armand asks her to marry him, but she declines.The idyll ends when Armand's father (Lionel Barrymore) comes to the house and, acknowledging her love is real, begs Marguerite to turn away from his son, knowing her past will ruin his chances at a career or profession or place in society. When Armand returns to the house, she is cold and dismissive and tells him the baron is expecting her. He watches her walk over the hill.Back in Paris, at a gambling club, Armand comes face to face with the baron and Marguerite, who is ill. Armand wins a fortune from the baron at Baccarat and begs Marguerite to come with him. She lies and says she loves the baron. Armand wounds the baron in a duel and must leave the country for six months. When he returns, Marguerite is deathly ill. \"Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart, where the world can't see me,\" she says. She dies in his arms."

Chan and Lee continue on foot until they see an expensive roadster leave another car and find a dead man in the other car. Upon investigating, they learn that the dead man was Renault, a bank messenger on his way to Paris with $1,000,000 in metallurgical bonds, now missing, which belonged to Victor Karnoff, who is staying at the Hotel Imperial. They also discover that three metallurgical bonds were that day offered for sale at a Monte Carlo bank by Al Rogers, a bartender at the hotel.Chan recognizes the roadster in front of the hotel and learns that it belongs to Evelyn Grey, who is a resident there. Police inspector Joubert and Chan find her with Paul Savarin, a stock broker and Karnoff's bitter rival. Although she admits stopping by the car, Evelyn says that she fled in fright when she saw Chan and Lee approach. Joubert learns from a messenger that Karnoff's chauffeur Ludwig, who drove Renault and was in league with Savarin, was found dead. Later that day, Karnoff's wife Joan, who earlier begged Rogers to give her back the three bonds, admits to him that she stole them from his room, and he gives her until noon the next day to repay him.The next morning, Evelyn promises Gordon Chase, Karnoff's secretary, that she will not see Savarin again. After Chan learns that Evelyn has been living in luxury with no visible means of income and that Joan pawned jewelry that morning for $25,000, the price of the three bonds, he and Joubert go to interrogate Rogers, but find him dead in his room with an open valise full of Karnoff's bonds. Joubert believes that Rogers committed suicide and that the case is closed, but Chan suggests they go to Karnoff's suite, where they also find Joan, Savarin, Gordon and Evelyn. Joan confesses that Rogers, whom she married seven years earlier and whom she thought had obtained a divorce, was blackmailing her. She had given him the three bonds, but stole them back when she learned of her husband's deal, and had her brother, Gordon, replace them in Karnoff's safe. Chan surmises that Gordon must be the murderer because only he had a key to the valise, and that the valise was found open in Rogers' room, with no damage to its lock. Gordon confesses and berates Evelyn, for whom he says he stole from Karnoff months ago. When he was in danger of being exposed, he murdered Rogers to place the blame on him. Gordon then escapes through a window, but he is run over by a car. Joubert insists that Evelyn and Savarin leave Monte Carlo and gives his friends, Chan and Lee, another send-off in the same, backfiring taxi."

Chan, Hopkins, the airplane owner, and Cartwright, the inventor of the device, take the dirigible Hindenburg to Berlin, which is currently hosting the 1936 Summer Olympic Games, to investigate three people traveling there by ocean liner: Dick Masters, an Olympic pole-vaulter and aviator, who did not pilot the plane the day of its disappearance because of an injured shoulder; Yvonne Roland, who visited Miller's room; and Arthur Hughes, an arms dealer, who wanted to buy the device.In Berlin, Chan finds the device hidden in a box in the luggage of Masters' girl friend Betty Adams. He substitutes a book and returns the box to Hopkins. Cartwright tells Chan that Hughes accused Hopkins of double-crossing him and threatened to expose Hopkins' plan to sell the device to a foreign government, and that Hopkins escaped with the box. Masters is now suspected because the box was found in Betty's room and the fact that he was on the boat with Roland. Roland, however, takes the box to a foreign diplomat, the Honorable Charles Zaraka, who discovers the book instead of the device.After Hughes learns of this, Chan's son Lee, an Olympic swimmer, is kidnapped. Following instructions sent from the kidnapper, Chan brings the device, which he has had removed and replaced with a transmitter, to an agreed upon location. He is then taken to Zaraka's estate, where Hopkins identifies the device. Hughes arrives with his thugs and fights Zaraka's henchmen for the device before he discovers that it is a phony. After the police arrive and Hopkins is shot, Chan reveals that Cartwright shot him, and that earlier Cartwright murdered Miller and made it appear that Hopkins stole the device. Hopkins recovers and Lee wins the hundred meter race."

        "sinopsis": "On an ocean liner approaching New York, a man unsuccessfully tries to steal a small package hidden in a woman's stateroom. The woman then hides the package in the room next to hers, which belongs to the celebrated Honolulu detective Charlie Chan and his son Lee (returning from Germany after their previous adventure in 'Charlie Chan at the Olympics').In New York, newspaper reporter Speed Patten slips into a taxi cab with the woman, whom he knows as Billie Bronson, and she promises to meet him at her hotel at midnight if he will keep quiet. As Speed reports the potential story to his editor Murdock, Murdock gets a call from Billie, who demands twice the amount he was willing to pay one year ago, and he sets up a meeting with her that night. Billie then bribes a bellhop for a key to Chan's room. As she tries to enter, Billie is spotted by Lee, and he follows her to the Hottentot Club, owned by racketeer Johnny Burke. There, mobster Buzz Moran warns Billie to get out of town before morning, after which she goes to Burke's office.Meanwhile, Speed, who has come to the club with photographer Joan Wendall, follows Burke to meet Billie. Billie accuses Burke, her former lover, of giving her the \"runaround\" because of his involvement with Marie Collins, a dancer in the club, and pulls a gun on Burke as Marie opens the door. Later that day, Inspector Nelson gets word that Billie has been killed and that Lee is being held as a suspect. Nelson orders Lee's release and questions Speed, Burke, Marie and Joan.At the crime scene, Chan notices that a napkin placed over a tray is not in a photograph which Joan took at the time of the murder. Just then, Louie, Burke's man, turns out the lights, and during a scuffle, Burke escapes. When the lights go on, Chan reveals that the key to his hotel room, which is present in the photograph, is now missing along with the napkin. Chan, Lee and Nelson return to Chan's room, where they find that the man on the boat who tried to rob Billie has just been killed. Marie then enters and recognizes him as her husband, Tom Mitchell. On the floor, Chan finds a crumpled page of a diary, which, he realizes, Mitchell was after. Chan finds Murdock in Billie's room, and Murdock explains that he was waiting to buy Billie's diary, which has information on racketeers and politicians in the city.The next day, after reading Speed's newspaper account of the murder, Moran confronts Burke. After Burke knocks down Moran, Moran shoots at him and misses. With his lawyer, Burke goes to police headquarters, where a para-fin test to determine whether there are traces of gun powder on his hands proves to be negative. Chan reminds Nelson that the napkin may have been used to cover the gun and warns Burke that he is still investigating him. When Burke finds Lee in his room trying to reconstruct the murder, he gives a black eye to Lee, who hits him back before being thrown out. Burke tries to leave town, but he is apprehended at the airport, along with Marie, and taken back to his office, where Murdock and Moran are also brought.Chan, Lee, Speed, Joan and Nelson also arrive at Burke's office, where Chan reveals that Mitchell was trying to get Billie's diary to ruin Burke, who stole his wife. Murdock then shows a page from the diary, which says that Speed used his newspaper job as a cover for blackmailing. Speed calls the page phony, and Chan accuses him of murder. Chan explains that he first suspected Speed when his newspaper account mentioned that Billie was shot in the back, a fact known only to the police and the murderer. Chan also reveals that he and Nelson planted the phony diary page to draw Speed out. Speed pulls a gun and confesses that he killed Billie because she was going to the district attorney with the diary, which implicated him. He then found Mitchell with the diary and killed him. He is about to shoot Chan when Lee jumps him. In the struggle, Speed is disarmed, while Lee gets a second black eye."

        "summary": "A veterinarian posing as a doctor teams with a singer and his friends as they struggle to save an upstate New York sanitarium with the help of a misfit racehorse.",
        "sinopsis": "The Standish sanitarium, located in the resort town of Sparkling Springs Lake, has fallen on hard times. Young Judy Standish (Maureen O'Sullivan) inherited the family business, along with its debts and mortgages, and is determined to keep going despite the fact that local businessman J.D. Morgan (Douglass Dumbrille) is pressuring her to sell out. Morgan needs the sanitarium property in order to expand his racetrack and resort hotel empire, and is conniving to have the sanitarium fail, aided by Judy's oily business manager, Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley), who is secretly in cahoots with Morgan.Judy's last hope is to request financial assistance from her most well-heeled client, the wealthy widow (and hypochondriac) Mrs. Emily Upjohn (Margaret Dumont). To Judy's dismay, Mrs. Upjohn storms into the lobby and announces that she is leaving. The incompetent medical staff has had the nerve to tell her there is nothing wrong with her. Mrs. Upjohn yearns for the ministrations of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, since \"I never knew a thing was wrong with me before I met him.\" Overhearing this exchange, Judy's loyal man-of-all-work Tony (Chico Marx) announces that Dr. Hackenbush will soon be arriving. He then rushes off to telegraph Hackenbush offering him a job. As Tony observes, \"If she want a hack-in-de-puss, she gonna get a hack-in-de-puss.\"Judy's fiancé Gil Stewart (Allan Jones) is hoping to make it as a singer, but in the meantime has come up with a quicker plan to earn enough to save the sanitarium and marry Judy. He has sunk all his savings into purchasing a race horse called Hi Hat, to be ridden by an eccentric local mute jockey named Stuffy (Harpo Marx). A couple of realities intrude on Gil's plan. Hi Hat's practice times are mediocre, and Gil has no money to keep up with the horse's expenses, causing the local sheriff (Robert Middlemass) to come after the horse to repossess it for the unpaid feed bill. Fortunately, some sleight-of-hand by Tony and Stuffy keeps the sheriff at bay for the time being. Gil is also dismayed that he has a sure thing tip for a race that afternoon, but no money to bet. Tony reassures him that he will get some money by finding a sucker.In Florida, Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush (Groucho Marx) is treating one of his clients, a horse, when the telegram arrives with the job offer. Aware that they can put a veterinarian in jail for treating people, he observes that he can also be put in jail for not paying his rent and has nothing to lose. Soon he arrives at Standish Sanitarium, where Judy appoints him chief of staff at the behest of Mrs. Upjohn, who has agreed to pay Hackenbush's salary and has hinted that she may help the sanitarium financially. The rest of the medical staff, and the scheming business manager Whitmore, are suspicious of Hackenbush's credentials, but he manages to double talk his way around them, and then, at the sound of the bugle call, heads for the racetrack. On his way to place a bet on Sunup, Hackenbush encounters Tony in the guise of an ice cream vendor. Tony offers a hot tip, which turns out to be in code, which a variety of code books and reference works are needed to interpret. After spending a wad of cash on useless books, Hackenbush winds up with a losing horse while Tony bets the profits on the winner - Sunup!Whitmore attempts to verify Hackenbush's credentials with the Florida Medical Board, but Hackenbush manages to divert the calls, to Whitmore's frustration. In order to keep an eye on Whitmore, Tony brings Stuffy into the sanitarium for treatment. During Hackenbush's examination of Stuffy, Tony discovers that Hackenbush is really a horse doctor. Hackenbush wants to flee, but Tony insists that he stay to try to help Judy. At the water carnival, where Gil is the featured vocalist, Hackenbush escorts Mrs. Upjohn but is distracted by a voluptuous blonde named Flo (Esther Muir), with whom he performs an energetic rumba and arranges a late-night rendezvous. Tony and Stuffy invade the bandstand and treat the audience to a comic musical performance. Afterwards, Stuffy overhears that Flo has been hired by Whitmore to lure Hackenbush into a compromising situation. He manages to convey this information to Tony, and the two rush to the rescue. Flo arrives at Hackenbush's suite at the sanitarium for a late night supper. Hackenbush tries to romance Flo, but Tony and Stuffy keep interrupting, first as house detectives, then as decorators hanging wallpaper. At the crucial moment, Whitmore leads the indignant Mrs. Upjohn to Hackenbush's suite, but Flo is safely hidden inside the sofa under a pile of wallpaper, and Mrs. Upjohn redirects her anger to Whitmore.Stuffy hides the horse in a room in the sanitarium. In a further attempt to discredit Hackenbush, Whitmore has brought in Dr. Steinberg (Sig Ruman), a pointy-bearded Austrian physician, to examine Mrs. Upjohn. Steinberg declares that he has never met a healthier woman in his life, to which Hackenbush retorts, 'You don't look as though you ever met a healthy woman.\" Pressured into demonstrating how he conducts an examination, Hackenbush, aided by Tony and Stuffy, manages to postpone doing so by repeated hand washing and other diversionary tactics. The examination eventually erupts into mayhem when Stuffy sets off the fire sprinkler, and the trio escapes riding Hi Hat.Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy, and Gil hide out with Hi Hat in a remote barn next to an African-American community. Judy arrives with blankets and Gil reassures her about the future. The locals are enjoying their day of rest with song and dance. The kids are fascinated by Stuffy, whom they identify as the angel Gabriel; Stuffy plays a tin whistle and leads them in a dance. A girl (Ivie Anderson) sings \"All God's Children Got Rhythm.\" Then the sheriff arrives along with Morgan to confiscate Hi Hat. Upon hearing Morgan's voice, Hi Hat bolts and clears a tall hedge with ease. Judy and Gil realize that the horse is a jumper, not a sprinter, and that Hi Hat's animosity toward Morgan can be used to advantage.The day of the big steeplechase has arrived, but all will be lost if Hi Hat cannot make the post time. Staking out the track, the sheriff once again wrests control of Hi Hat, but then Judy gets the horse back by staging a road accident.Meanwhile, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy come up with various and hilarious stratagems for delaying the start of the race. To Morgan's dismay, Stuffy appears at the last moment on Hi Hat, ready to race. After seeing Morgan's photo, Hi Hat easily makes the first jump, but then Stuffy loses the picture. Hackenbush comes up with an alternate plan - he finds a microphone hooked up to the public address system and gets Morgan to talk into it, thus energizing Hi Hat. The jockey of Morgan's horse has been instructed to play dirty, and does so. Eventually Hi Hat and Morgan's horse wind up falling into a big mud puddle. They recover and race to the finish, with Morgan's jockey edging out Stuffy. Judy and Gil's disappointment is palpable, but when Morgan arrives to claim the prize, the winning horse reacts negatively to him and Stuffy realizes that it is really Hi Hat - the jockeys had switched horses in the mud. The race is won, the sanitarium is saved, Judy and Gil can marry, and most amazing of all, Hackenbush proposes marriage to Mrs. Upjohn!"

Irene aspires to become a Hollywood actress, so she and Waldo begin taking acting lessons from Charlie Lodge (William Powell), a free-spirited artist living in a trailer. Margit, a hard-working businesswoman, disapproves of Charlie's carefree lifestyle.Irene falls in love with Charlie after becoming fed up with Waldo's lack of initiative and Margo's insistence on organizing everything for them. Charlie seemingly returns her feelings, but he is only pretending to do so in order to get closer to Margit. When Margit learns of her sister's infatuation, she confronts Charlie. He agrees to stop seeing Irene if Margit will let him paint her portrait, to which Margit reluctantly agrees. As they spend more time together, Margit begins to warm to Charlie's bohemian charms. Meanwhile, Charlie tries to help Waldo stand up for himself so he can win back Irene, but with little luck.Margit spots Irene in Charlie's trailer; she had showed up unexpectedly and Charlie was trying to get her to leave. Margit believes Charlie lied about giving Irene up and angrily smashes his portrait of her over his head. However, Charlie has one last trick up his sleeve: he arranges for a wedding ceremony to be held in his trailer, apparently to marry Irene, but really a plan to simultaneously reconcile Irene and Waldo and win Margit's hand. As Charlie and Irene are saying their vows, Irene realizes she does still love Waldo. Charlie confesses to Margit that he loves her; she finally admits that she reciprocates his feelings. A drunk Waldo then shows up, knocks Charlie out with a punch, and carries off Irene, much to her delight. As Charlie regains consciousness, he kisses Margit, only for an Academy Award statuette to fall from above and knock them both out as a wreath falls over them."

        "sinopsis": "The time is circa 1900, the place is rural northern China. Wang Lung, a humble farmer, makes tea for his father and takes a bath one morning. Given how poor he is, both of these are extravagant, but it is a special occasion: his wedding day. Wang goes to the marketplace and then on to the house of the local great lord to collect his new bride, a former kitchen slave named Olan. After returning home, Wang invites a few of his friends and relatives over for a meal, which though modest was still extravagant by his standards. Among the guests are Wang's shiftless uncle, and his neighbor Ching. Olan plants a peach pit behind the house on the first night.Olan proves to be a diligent, frugal, and industrious wife to Wang. She cooks meals for Wang and his father, makes and mends clothes, takes care of the chores around the house, and helps Wang work in the fields, even after she becomes pregnant. A nasty storm comes in right at harvest time, and Olan rushes into the fields to help bring in the wheat before it can blow or wash away, despite being in the early stages of labor. Thanks to Olan, Wang is able to save most of his wheat crop. Shortly afterward, Olan delivers Wang's first child, a son. No sooner is the child born than Olan is back at work, helping turn the harvested wheat into finished grain, ready to cook or sell. Wang sells his surplus wheat for a handsome profit.Wang hears from his uncle that the great lord is in financial distress, as wealth had made him complacent and lazy, without enough income to finance his lavish spending on luxuries such as opium. Wang and Olan return to the great house, where Olan shows off her new son to her former mistress and co-workers while Wang takes some of his profits from the wheat to buy one of the great lord's fields, on which he will grow rice.The years pass and Wang prospers. By 1910, he has five fields, and Olan has borne him a second son and a daughter. However, luck turns against him. Drought takes hold across northern China, and Wang's crops fail. With Wang and Olan, their three children, his father, and his mooching uncle to feed, his stored food is soon exhausted. Famine takes hold across the land. Wang does not have the heart to butcher his beloved ox, so Olan does it instead, and the family has food for a week but no ox to pull the plow next year. Wang's neighbors, including Ching, become suspicious that Wang is hoarding food and break into his house, but find that by that time, Wang and his family are literally eating dirt. Wang reflects that he was wise to invest in land, for food and money would have been stolen.Wang's uncle and some of his friends try to take advantage of Wang's desperation, by offering to buy his land for a tiny fraction of what it cost him. Wang is a broken man and ready to sell out, but Olan rallies Wang's courage, reminding him that not only will he have nothing next year if he sells, there is no food for the money to buy anyway. Wang refuses to sell the land. Instead, he says, he and Olan and their children and his father will join tens of thousands of others traveling south on the \"fire wagon\" - the steam powered train, relatively new to China - in search of work and food.Upon arriving in a southern city, Wang builds a hut in a shanty town and looks for work, but there are far more men streaming into the city than jobs available for them, and Wang has no luck. The children and the elderly father turn to begging, but fail at that task, too. Wang contemplates what was once unthinkable: selling his daughter into slavery. Wang catches a break when a man in an adjacent hut dies in a work accident. Wang rushes to take his place before anyone else can, and finds himself pulling heavy carts through the muck for a very low wage.Wang becomes angry at his sons when they steal food, not wanting them to grow up as thieves. Olan cooks the stolen food anyway, for they must eat if they are to live. Each day for Wang is spent simply trying to survive to the next day, and he despairs of ever seeing his farm again, especially after he meets another man who was forced off the land ten years earlier and has still not raised enough money to return home, much less buy seed, tools, and draft animals. Wang fears his fate will be the same.The teeming, impoverished masses of people become more hungry and discontent, and a soapbox speaker informs them that armies are on the move and a revolution is brewing. Wang cares nothing for this, but when the speaker mentions offhand that it is raining in the north, Wang perks up. The drought is over, and he can farm again, if only he can get back home. Soon, the revolution arrives in the city. The security forces flee the city, and the masses of people first loot the marketplace and then break into and pillage the local great house, taking anything they can carry. While Wang gathers food, Olan enters the great house and is trampled. However, she finds a bag of valuable jewels left behind when all the other rioters have left.A new army arrives in the city. They inform the people that the Manchu Dynasty has fallen, ending 21 centuries of Imperial China's history. China is now to be a republic. However, they take a dim view of the looting. They begin searching people and summarily shooting anyone found to have stolen anything of value. Olan is alarmed, for she has taken the jewels. Just before the soldiers discover the jewels in Olan's clothes, their commander arrives and tells them that they must drop what they're doing and march again, thus saving Olan's life. The soldiers leave with a stern warning to the people that they are republicans, not bandits.Wang and Olan are reunited, and with their new wealth, they are able to return home and buy two new oxen, farm tools, and plenty of seed. Wang sells the jewels, except for two small pearls which he gives to Olan. Wang discovers that Ching and some of the other villagers were forced to sell their land to survive. Wang forgives them for breaking into his house and hires them as farmhands. Wang's uncle half-jokingly suggests that Wang is now rich enough to take a second wife, much to Olan's dismay.Wang's prosperity is restored. His sons go to school and learn to read, something Wang never learned himself. They help Wang with his business and accounting. His daughter, however, never completely recovers from the famine; it appears that malnutrition has left her mentally retarded. As Wang grows richer, he begins to spend some money on niceties - tea, entertainment, fancy clothes, and an imported mechanical alarm clock. Soon, he buys the great house from the now-bankrupt landlord. Olan is unhappy, having many bad memories of being a slave in that house. Wang also becomes interested in another woman, Lotus, and takes her home as a concubine. Olan bears this betrayal as best she can, even after Wang takes the pearls to give to Lotus. Wang's increasingly senile father also dislikes Lotus.Lotus, having no friends in the house, becomes lonely while Wang is working. Soon, she makes friends with Wang's second son, who is also dissatisfied with his life and wishes to leave to seek glory as a soldier. The Republic of China in the 1920s was unstable, and there were battles to be had if he sought them. It is unclear whether Wang's son and Lotus were ever more than friends, but the gossip spread around town. When Ching finally tells Wang what was right in front of his face, Wang angrily dismisses him. He then returns to the house and finds his son and Lotus talking. Outraged, he beats his son and kicks both him and Lotus out of the house.As the second son is making his goodbyes to his mother Olan, Wang's uncle arrives and tells them that a plague of locusts is approaching, and the crops are in danger. All the members of the older generation are fearful of their livelihood, but Wang's son uses the knowledge he got at school to tell them how to fight the locusts by selectively burning and flooding some areas, sacrificing part of the cropland to save some of the fields, which otherwise would have been devoured. Wang, rediscovering his love of the land, gets to work, along with his sons and neighbors. Only his shiftless uncle does not pitch in. The plan works, and Wang is able to salvage some of his crops. He welcomes back Ching.Wang's elder son is soon to be married to the local grain merchant's daughter, with hopes for grandsons for Wang. Olan, however, has been sick for some time, and now she is dying. Wang returns the pearls to her and tries to comfort her, now realizing that she was the best wife a man could want and he was wrong to turn to Lotus. After she dies, he buries her near the tree she planted at the beginning and says aloud, \"Olan, you are the earth.\""

        "summary": "During WWI, two French soldiers are captured and imprisoned in a German P.O.W. camp. Several escape attempts follow until they are eventually sent to a seemingly inescapable fortress.",
        "sinopsis": "During the First World War, two French aviators, aristocratic Captain de Boeldieu (played by Pierre Fresnay) and working-class Lieutenant Maréchal (Jean Gabin), embark on a flight to examine the site of a blurred spot on photos from an earlier air reconnaissance mission. They are shot down by a German aviator and aristocrat, Rittmeister (Cavalry Captain) von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim). Von Rauffenstein, upon returning to base, sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu discover they have mutual acquaintancesa depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.De Boeldieu and Maréchal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of fellow French prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic battle of Verdun. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Maréchal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into \"La Marseillaise\". As a result of the disruption, Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; ironically, the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. De Boeldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.De Boeldieu and Maréchal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Von Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been promoted, but reassigned, much to his regret. Von Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.At Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio), from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew, a naturalized French citizen, son of a Polish father and Danish mother, who generously shares the food parcels he receives. De Boeldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. De Boeldieu volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that de Boeldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Maréchal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.Von Rauffenstein has the guards stop shooting at de Boeldieu and pleads with his fellow aristocrat to give himself up. De Boeldieu refuses, and von Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him in the stomach (though he was aiming for the legs). Nursed in his final moments by a remorseful von Rauffenstein, de Boeldieu laments that their usefulness to society (as aristocrats) will end with this war and that unlike the working class or the middle class, for the nobility, dying in war is a honorable way out. He also pities von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the emerging social order.Maréchal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to get to nearby Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Maréchal down. They quarrel and part, but then Maréchal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa (Dita Parlo), who has lost her husband at Verdun, along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories.\" She generously takes them in, and doesn't betray them to a passing German army patrol. Maréchal begins to fall in love with her, and she with him, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty to the war effort after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Maréchal declares his intention to come back for Elsa and her daughter, Lotte, after the war.A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. The soldiers fire a few rounds, but then an officer orders them to cease fire, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland. We last glimpse the pair from a distance, trudging through deep snow, their future uncertain."

        "sinopsis": "Act 1 La Corrida The first opening shot is over the ocean as the camera pans over to the citizens of Puerto Rico on a mountaintop singing and dancing. Considerable amounts of people are watching a mariachi band play with the accompaniment of a women dancer. A man then begins to sing. The camera then pans to a shot of the main character Astree and her aunt as they watch the show. After the show has ended there is a big applause from the audience as flowers are thrown onto the performers. Astree thinks the show was wonderful while her aunt remains un-amused. They leave the show early due to the aunts displease and as a citizen informs them that the show is not yet over Astrees aunt states that she has had enough noise for her money. The Aunt refuses to see anymore and asks for a chuffer home while her nice is still intrigued with the music. As the women drive to their hotel the chuffer, with a flower placed in his hair begins to sing La Habanera pleasing Astree and annoying her aunt. The aunt finally demands for him to be quiet and the two women begin to exclaim their difference of opinion considering the city of Puerto Rico, Astree exclaiming its beauty and her want to stay while her aunt complains of the hot weather further stating that Astree is out of her mind for ever wanting to come much less stay. Astrees aunt refuses to let her niece stay and states that Astree will be going back to their home town of Stockholm whether she likes it or not. Astree claims that Stockholm is a cold place that knows nothing of true nature. The discussion ends with Astrees aunt stating that Astree is acting like a savage. The two women arrive at a small Puerto Rican town that Astree claims as paradise while gazing at the Riviera. Astrees aunt is displeased and states that the people residing in the town are un-civilized and not well bred to which Astree replies that she prefers savages. The two women then drive on to a bull show. On the way the chuffer runs into a Puerto Rican solider and they begin to get into a scuffle. The car cannot move forward because of a roadblock due to the yearly bullfight that takes place. Astrees aunt is infuriated that they cannot move on and begins to complain. As the driver tries to convince the solider to let them pass Don Pedro, a handsome and important figure in the Puerto Rican government, interrupts the conversation. Don Pedro exclaims his pleasure to meet the two women and then orders the solider to let them pass. The women and Don Pedro then arrive at the bullfight where many people have gathered to watch. Don Pedro graciously escorts the ladies to their seats after which he waves to his many admires. Here we begin to see Astree take a romantic interest in Don Pedro and is obvious power over the town she apparently loves so dearly. Don Pedro then throws his glove to the fighter in the ring signaling the show to being. While the fight is taking place Don Pedro explains how excellent the bull is while Astree seems a bit troubled and frightened at the danger of the fight. Don Pedro assures her that this is how the people prefer to see the show and the fight continues. Soon after Astrees aunt gets up in displease stating that the whole affair is barbaric. She thanks god that their ship leaves the next day. Don Pedro is saddened when he hears that Astree will be leaving him so soon. The bullfight then begins to get very intense as the bull nocks around the fighters one by one finally pulling one man to the ground. Astree then screams, Why dont you help him? to which Don Pedro replies As you command as he jumps into the ring to fight the bull himself. While doing so Astree ignores the call of her aunt to leave and watches as Don Pedro kills the bull with a sword handed to him from the audience. In all the excitement Astree drops her fan and then sighs in relieve when the fight is over. It is only after the fight does Astree return to her aunt who is greatly displeased with her niece. Astrees aunt further scorns her for admiring the town stating that Astree is acting as if she is under a spell. Astree is impervious to her aunts comments and is smitten by Don Pedros braveness. Astree states that she would gladly be the wife of a man like Don Pedro then that of a banker in Stockholm. Astrees aunt is convinced that her niece has gone mad. Don Pedro then steps in between the two of them after coming out of the bullfight and assures them that none of the men in the bullfight where hurt. Astrees aunt orders her to come home with her but not before Don Pedro graciously returns Astrees fan. Astrees aunt becomes displeased at this game because apparently in Puerto Rican culture a man begins courting a lady by presenting her with an open fan. Astree tries to calm her aunt by telling her that she truly didnt knowAct 2 Abandon ShipAstree and her aunt begin to board their ship back to Stockholm and as Don Pedro kindly sees them to their steamer the women pass many Puerto Rican attractions that temp Astree to stay. Don Pedro asks if Astree will ever come back to which Astree replies perhaps. Astrees aunt is appalled at her reply and orders her to get on the ship and wait while she arranges their rooms. In the distance Astree hears the tune of La Habanera and is convinced to get off the ship without informing her aunt and join Don Pedro. In a romantic reunion Astree and Don Pedro kiss while Astrees aunt begins to realize that her niece has stayed with the so-called savages.Act 3 The New MistressAstree and Don Pedro are then married in an elaborate Puerto Rican wedding and taken off to their estate. When the couple arrives at their home their servants bow to them and wish them luck as they enter their house to which Don Pedro and Astree thank them. Don Pedro then calls upon his servant and old nanny Rosita who had until know remained the mistress of the house. Don Pedro orders Rosita to hand his new wife the key to the household, which Rosita is obviously very reluctant to do. After another stern order Rosita hands over the key to Astree. Astree gives Rosita a ring as a friendly gesture in exchange for the keys, which Don Pedro must order Rosita to accept. After this Rosita then gives Astree a telegram from her aunt back in Stockholm stating that as a wedding gift she would gladly pay for the divorce, Astree gladly lets Don Pedro rip it up. We then see Rosita throw Astrees ring out her bedroom window.Act 4 Back in Stockholm Ten years later in the town of Stockholm there is a party-taking place in the mist of snowy white weather. Dr. Nagel (an old lover and friend of Astree) and Dr. Gomez are introduced to the guests as they enter the scene. After avoiding an annoying patient Dr. Nagel greets Astrees aunt, a founder of their tropics institute. The two doctors can only stay at the party for a few minutes before they have to make an urgent trip to Puerto Rico regarding an unknown fever affecting the town. When Astrees aunt hears that the handsome doctor is going to the town of Puerto Rico she asks him to find her niece, Astree, and bring her back to Stockholm.Act 5 The Meddlers ArriveWhen the doctors arrive in Puerto Rico they are referred to as intruders and snoops which Puerto Rican officials want nothing to do with. The officials state that their goal is to make the doctors lives miserable and that their salvation could never come from Sweden of all places. The officials also speak of Don Pedros annoyance with doctors. The officials reflect back on a time when the Rockefeller institute sent snoops to aid the Puerto Rican fever eight years ago stating that their serum was questionable. The officials also talk of the rumors regarding the fever, which decimated their trade for three years. The affects of which made the island plunge downhill. The officials state that their economys downward spiral is due to people like Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez who snoop to find germs and intern ruin Puerto Ricos reputation. The conversation ends with the officials claiming that the Puerto Rican fever does not exist and that Don Pedro himself stated this fact. The officials then plot to get Dr. Gomez and Dr. Nagel deported. Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez arrive at the Pedro De Avila Hospital. When Dr. Gomez asks whom Pedro Avila is Dr. Nagel describes him as the founder and local bigwig who tyrannizes the American prefect. The doctors who work within the hospital see Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez approaching the facilities. The doctors of Puerto Rico state that Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomes must not see any of their research especially no cases of the Puerto Rican fever. The Doctors of Puerto Rico also state that their quests will no be allowed to take a single drop of blood from any of their patients in order to prevent any scandals. The doctors of Puerto Rico admit to the breakout of the fever and that the doctors could potentially help but do not want to upset their government or economy. Although the Doctors see the epidemic occurring before them they continue to stand by the governments official statement: There is no fever. The doctors of Puerto Rico feel an obligation to stick by Don Pedros believes because he founded the hospital.Act 6 A Jealous MasterWe are then brought to the home of Don Pedro and Astree. Don Pedro stands aside angrily exclaiming that their son Juan has turned nine years old and that it is customary for him to attend a bullfight on their patron saints day and that their is nothing Astree can do to stop him from raising their son as his successor. Don Pedro states that Astree has made their son Juan estranged from Pedro. Don Pedro angrily rips Astrees dress, which is lying on a chair next to him. He then calls Astree cruel and egotistical. He then commands her to obey him and states that he will not become a Swede. Astree reveals herself from her room and tells Don Pedro that he need not yell at her because she knows that he is the master of the house and of the entire island. Astree is shocked when she sees her torn up dress. Don Pedro explains that he tore it up because an English Marine officer told her she looked pretty in it once. Astree then says, Your jealousy is really incomprehensible Don Pedro and Astree then continue to argue about faithfulness and weather or not one would cheat on the other. Don Pedro states that Astree is only with him because of their son and if it where not for him she would have left a long time ago. Astree admits that he is correct. In the next room Rosita gets young Juan ready for his first bullfight, while Astree and Don Pedro continue to fight. During Astree and Pedros argument Astree admits that it was wrong of her to move to Puerto Rico and marry Pedro. Astree states that her aunt was right from the very beginning and that the land she dwells in is still foreign to her just as her husband is foreign to her. Astree states that everything she once loved about Puerto Rico has turned repulsive from the eternal summer to the very house she lives in and most of all the Habanera that drives her crazy. Astree claims that what she thought was paradise has turned into hell. After her confession Don Pedro states that their son Juan will be in the care of Rosita and not Astree. Pedro is angered by the fact that Astree is only with him because of the child and therefore threatens to take him away from her by letting Rosita have full care of him. Pedro then tells Astree to get it through her head that he is taking Juan away from her and that one-day Juan will regret that he was born of a Swedish mother. Don Pedro then walks out of the room in anger. Astree walks to her window and rings for a servant. She asks her servant to have a horse saddled so she can ride to the city.Act 7 Means of Escape The scene then cuts back to Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez walking down the halls of Avila hospital. The two converse about how uncomfortable the Puerto Rican doctors behaved and how odd it was that they where not presented flowers or wine. Dr. Gomez then replies, You already know from the Philippines how the natives act. When strangers come and stick their nose into everything. The two doctors then exit the hospital grounds and discuss what happened last time a serum was invented to treat the Puerto Rican fever. Dr. Nagel states that the serum was not even approved by the government and that he is certain that the medical superintendent appears to be on the defense because he doesnt want outside help due to the sensational press from the last occurrence. Dr. Nagel states that the Puerto Rican government wont be able to keep it secret for long because the fever is already in the air. Dr. Nagel then spots his long lost love Astree riding her carriage into town. The two doctors then head back to their hotel to unpack their things. The scene then transitions to Astree in a travel agency arranging for her and her sons secret departure to Stockholm. The agent informs Astree that the soonest departure is on Thursday, July 12. She arranges two first class cabins to New York with a connection to Europe. The agent asks for a small down payment of ten percent but Astree just gives him the full price of the trip. Back in her Puerto Rican home Astrees son Juan lays on a fur rug reading a comic while his mother plays him the piano. Little Juan exclaims, Mama, it must be beautiful in Sweden! To which Astree replies, Yes darling. Much more beautiful then here. Little Juan then asks, What is snow? Astree describes snow as millions and billions of frozen angel tears and masses of tiny little starts, very soft and cold that melt in your hand when you touch them. Astree tells Juan that when you taste snow it is slightly sweet and not bitter like human tears. She assures her son that he will soon see snow. Little Juan then asks his mother to sing a song she wrote for him. Astree begins to sing to Juan as he complements her beauty. Astree states that as long as Juan loves her she will always look pretty, just for him. Astree then begins to sing Juan her song about snow and wintertime in Stockholm. After the song Astree confesses to her son that they will be going to Sweden in 10 days.Act 8 There is no fever The scene cuts back to Avila hospital; two Puerto Rican doctors discuss how the first cases of the Puerto Rico fever are being reported. One doctor refuses to believe that the fever even exists. More and more people are being taken into the hospital for the fever. Over eleven cases in one night are reported and hospital becomes worried that they will soon run out of beds. Officials and doctors of the Puerto Rican government discuss the situation. Although the doctors are worried about the fever they are more concerned about Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez gathering materials regarding the fever such as infected blood-containing pathogens. The government decides to seal off the waterfront for preventative measures although it is inurn endangering the guards that do so. The government also decides to shadow Dr. Gomez and Dr. Nagel. The government official then resumes his plans to join Don Pedro at a club.Act 9 The Cuckoo SongBack at the Avila home Astree plays and sings the cuckoo song with her son Juan. In the Hotel of Dr. Gomez and Nagel the two discuss their frustrations with the Puerto Rican government as well as their determination to cure the disease. The doctors then continue to conduct experiments in their hotel room the doctors are determined to conduct a parallel analysis of a New York case study to the Puerto Rico fever. Before Dr. Nagel goes out to collect a sample Dr. Gomes warns him and suggest that he takes a revolver with him, to which Nr. Nagel jokingly denies. Dr. Nagel tells Gomez that the code for letting him back in the room is seven quick knocks at the door. Nagel then leaves to collect samples.Act 10 OutbreaksAt the waterfront Dr. Nagel tries slipping past a guard but is confronted by one of the solders. After trying to sweat talk the solider into letting him pass Dr. Nagle notices how sickly the solider is. The guard faints and Dr. Nagel takes a sample of his blood for testing. A group of men pass by the doctor and the victim lying in the street. Dr. Nagel tells the men to take the guard to the hospital and then returns back to his hotel room. Back in the Avila home Astree becomes very worried over her sickly son, but luckily his fever is not as serious as the other cases. In the hotel room of Dr. Gomez and Nagel we see Gomez enjoying a cold shower in the mist of the hot weather. During Gomezs shower there is a knock at the door, it is Dr. Nagel returning from his experience with the guard. Dr. Nagel tells Gomez what had happened and that this case of the fever happens more suddenly then the one that occurred in New York. The two Doctors are pleased when they see the specimen collected from the guard.Act 11 Memories of a FlameBack in the Avila home Don Pedro and the other officials play cards. When Don Pedro wins his friend makes a rude statement: Lucky in cards but unlucky in love which deeply upsets Don Pedro. Don Pedro is then informed of Astrees trip to Europe. Instead of acting surprised Don Pedro just says that it is a trip he had promised his wife. A government official then interrupts their conversation to inform Don Pedro that there is news of the two foreign doctors. The officials realize that Nagel and Gomez must have taken blood from the guard who had fainted at the waterfront. The officials become worried that Nagel and Gomez will spread news of the fever. Don Pedro decides to take the situation into his own hands by inviting the doctors to his home. While conducting their experiments back in the hotel room the two doctors become suspicious of spys outside their room but try to stay focused on their work. In the home of Avila Astree fans herself in bed and is startled when she hears her husband storm in the room. Astree tells Don Pedro that their son was not well but assures him that he will be fine. Don Pedro asks if Juan is well enough to go on a journey to which Astree replies: I am determined to go back to Europe. Don Pedro asks if Astree knows of a Dr. Sven Nagel. Astree confesses that they once had a relationship, which makes Don Pedro very jealous. Don Pedro then informs Astree that he has invited the doctor to their home, which makes Astree very distraught. Astree tells Don Pedro that she cant stand to be reminded of home. The couple then gets into a disagreement over the Puerto Rican fever. She agrees with the Dr. Nagel and Gomez while Don Pedro feels that his government can take care of their own people. The conversation ends with Don Pedro telling Astree to be prepared for the dinner, which will host twenty-five guests.Act 12 A Dinner EngagementIn the hotel room the two doctors celebrate their hard work. A knock at the door worries them. A piece of mail is slid under the door; it is an invitation to Don Pedros dinner party. In an excited frenzy Dr. Nagel runs off to get a haircut and shave before the party. In the Avila home Astree paces back and forth nervously awaiting her guests while young Juan sings and plays. When Don Pedro enters the room the laughing and playing end and Astree informs her son to put away his toys and go to his room. Don Pedro apologizes to Astree about being so stern with her about the trip to Europe and asks if he could accompany her. He tells her that he loves her although he doesnt display it very often. Astree tells Don Pedro that she does not want him to go to Europe with her and her son because she ultimately wants to stay in Sweden forever, not just a few months as Don Pedro had planed. Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez then walk into the household. Dr. Nagel spots little Juan with a sled and is intrigued. Dr. Nagel begins to play with Juan as they pretend to slide down a mountain of snow that is in fact that Avila staircase. In their moment of laugher Astree spots her son amusing the guests. Don Pedro is not amused with the games and orders Juan to put the sled away and go to his room. Introductions are then made as Astree informs the doctors that it was not her who invited them but rather her husband. While the two doctors are being entertained the government officials raid their hotel room.Act 13 La Habanera The party now begins to take full swing as Dr. Gomez and Don Pedro discuss the conditions of Puerto Rico. Don Pedro is annoyed with their presence and cannot understand why they feel obligated to intrude on Puerto Rican land. In the other room Dr. Nagel speaks to Astree in private. Dr. Nagel says that he never expected to see her so unhappy. Astree asks him to stop making such comments but Dr. Nagel continues his honest opinion stating that she has suffered far too much. She tells him that he is mistaken. Don Pedro notices his wife talking to Dr. Nagel and becomes jealous. Dr. Nagel assures Astree that she cannot deceive him and that he knows how truly unhappy she is. Dr. Nagel knows that Astree wants to return to Sweden. Unable to stand the sight of his wife talking to another man Don Pedro asks if the investigation of the doctors hotel room has been completed. Back in the hotel room the investigation of the Doctors private studies continues. In the Avila home a mariachi band starts to play as more quests arrive. Astree tells Dr. Nagel that he is in danger but he is not concerned with that. Astree asks him to go home and not worry about her. Dr. Nagel confesses that he is still in love with her and cannot leave her alone. Dr. Nagel is convinced that she too has feelings for him and reminds her of her sons wellbeing. Dr. Nagel tells Astree that her son will ruin if he continues to grow up in Puerto Rico. In all the emotion Astree drops her fan and Dr. Nagel picks it up and hands it to her. Astree then leaves Dr. Nagel to entertain her other guests. Astree goes to her husband and asks if she may sing La Habanera in an effort to make amends. Don Pedro is delighted to hear that Astree wants to sing and graciously lets her and his mood changes from that of jealously to excitement. Astree puts on the costume Don Pedro had made her and begins to sing La Habanera to the guests. After the song Don Pedro thanks her and states that she has given him a gift that all his wealth could never buy.Act 14 Arrests Two officials walk in the room and Astree asks why they are there. The officials say that they are going to arrest the two Doctors for conducting bacteriological experiments in a hotel room. Astree asks her husband to let the charges go but he is determined to ruin Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomezs careers. Astree then flees to find Dr. Nagel and warn him. While warning Dr. Nagel about his arrest she asks if he will take her and her son back to Sweden with him. The two embrace and she confesses her torment in Puerto Rico. Astree goes to change while Don Pedro reviews the charges. While speaking to an official about the reports Don Pedro collapses to the ground and is diagnosed with the Puerto Rico fever. Dr. Nagel and Dr. Gomez run to his aid ready to eject him with the anecdote they created. The officials tell the doctors that while inspecting their hotel room they confiscated the anecdote and on Don Pedros orders destroyed it. Dr. Nagel then states that Don Pedro Avila has dug his own grave. Don Pedro quickly dies of the fever.Act 15 A New Day While morning the death of her husband Astree boards the ship back to Sweden with her son and the doctors Gomez and Nagel. As the ship pulls away Astree sees the Puerto Rican citizens sing and dance on the waterfront and waves goodbye. Astree returns to Sweden with her son and new lover Dr. Nagel and says that she has no regrets."

        "sinopsis": "As a writer who, like Charles Dickens, saw no part of society unworthy of his attention and scrutiny, Emile Zola (Paul Muni) gradually rises, through his novels, as a moralist who semes to understand, empathize with, and appreciate people in all stations in life. His fame and credibility as a champion of the people give him the courage to intervene in the notorious Dreyfus affair, in which Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, is, despite the lack of evidence against him, found guilty of the treasonous acts of another Army officer and exiled to Devil's Island. Within a year of Dreyfus' arrest, it becomes clear to several in the French army that Dreyfus was innocent, but they resolve to sweep the mistake under the rug rather than rectify it.When it later becomes evident to Zola that the Dreyfus affair is a coverup, the resolution of which might impugn the honor of the French army, he realizes that he won't have an easy time exposing the truth, but he tries. He is incensed when the real perpetrator, Esterhazy, is found innocent in a rigged court martial hearing. Disenchanted, Zola risks his career and fame by writing a letter to the President of France and has it published in a major newspaper. The article, called J'Accuse, is a direct accusation of the French army in covering up the innocence of Dreyfus to protect one of its own, and the result of this unpopular letter is the arrest of Zola on a libel charge. To the army's dismay, the court proceedings against him give Zola an even greater platform from which to publicly expose the weakness of the case against Dreyfus.In the courtroom, the army has little choice but to try to bully and discredit the popular Zola, and causes him to be shunned by many, even in the country in which he is a revered novelist and moralist. Rather than remaining in France after his conviction, Zola sees it fit to flee to England, his courage and conviction in uncovering the truth unimpaired. The Dreyfus case is ultimately reopened, and Dreyfus is offered a pardon, which he accepts. Dreyfus is set free and promoted in the French army, and Zola can now return to French soil, his actions vindicated by the pardon.Sadly, Zola dies before the French court fully exonerates Dreyfus, but his valiant fight in the Dreyfus affair only added to his reputation of one of France's greatest men. Zola's courageous and zealous pursuit of the truth in his novels and in his life make him a symbol of morality and integrity for the ages."

One such ronin (masterless samurai) Matajuro, spends his day looking for work whilst his wife, Otaki, makes cheap paper balloons at home. One rainy night, Shinza, a barber, and equally penniless, impulsively abducts the daughter of a wealthy merchant, hiding her at Matajuros home. Their desperate plan has grave consequences when a ransom attempt backfires. The film is deeply pessimistic, insisting that life in feudal Japan was hellish and short for those at the foot of the social ladder."

        "sinopsis": "Having got off the train, Rudolf Rassendyll, a British subject, dressed up in the typical tweeds of an English sportsman, is going through passport check at a small principality somewhere in Europe. He is asked whether he is here for the coronation, he tells them he is on a fishing holiday. He notices that people keep staring at him.\nHe thinks it must be his dress. By way of explanation he says Of course you dont dress this way in your country, but you see we dont dress your way in England. His English humour is lost on his audience. Actually, minus his goatee, he has a striking resemblance to the soon to be crowned king of the principality.While fishing in what turns out be to extremely troubled waters, he is spotted by the king and his body guards, an old Colonel and his aide, the young David Niven, also out hunting. The king Rudolf V and the commoner Rudolf stare at each other. The king, who has already had a few, says, \"It is too early in the day to be seeing double. On comparing notes they find out that they are cousins, far, far, far removed. Rudolf with his typical British humour says We owe this kinship to your great-great-great-grandfather Rudolf and my great-great-great-grandmother Amelia.\"The king is delighted and says, then you must attend my coronation tomorrow, but for now let us retreat to my hunting lodge for drinks and dinner. The drinking and the gaiety goes on and on under the watchful eyes of the Colonel. A toast is drunk to great-great-great-grandfather Rudolf and is reciprocated for great-great-great-grandmother Amelia.\"Who should we drink to now, asks the already tipsy king. I would drink to prince Michael, my half brother, but he does not love me. He thinks the world is wrong. He thinks he ought to be me and I ought to be he.\nLet us instead drink to my cousin Flavia soon to be my bride and queen. I havent seen her for years, she and I did not get on very well then. Perhaps we shall now. They say she is too good for me, perhaps she is. You know what they say about me dont you? I drink too much.\"The king wants another bottle brought from the cellar for his English guest. The king pours a drink but finds that his guest is already snoring. He drinks it himself and slumps to the floor.In the morning one sniff of the bottle tells the Colonel that the king has been drugged, most certainly the handiwork of the black prince Michael to keep the king away from the coronation. It appears the king will not come around for many hours. He tells Rudolf, \"if my king is not crowned today, he never will be. Prince Michael wants the crown and the queen. Only you can help us.\"\"My dear Colonel I came here on a fishing trip, I like to fish. I couldnt begin to act like a king even if I tried. I wouldnt deceive any body. Saying this he starts smiling. Colonel What do you find so amusing.\"\"It would be a scene wouldnt it, the cathedral crowded to the doors, Organ booming, I kneel to be crowned. Then your friend Michael steps forward and says This isnt the king. This is an Englishman named Rudolf Rassendyll.\nColonel - Then Michael sits on the throne today and the king lies in prison or his grave, and Princess Flavia marries that scoundrel.\"\"You cant let that happen to her.\"\"Can you?\"\"Rudolf ruminating, After all, it would only for a day. Wouldnt it.\"\"By tonight you will be safely across the border.\"\"King for a day. What would it mean if I fail.\"\"Your life and mine and of young David.\"\"The king is laid down in the cellar in charge of the lodge keeper. As they depart, David salutes the king, \"Sleep well sire, we go to see you crowned.\"During the train journey to the capital, Rudolf is briefed on the coronation ceremony and made to learn by rote the speech he would have to make. As they alight the train the Colonel murmurs God save the king. Rudolf says God save both of them.Prince Michael is planning to announce that the king will not be coming for the coronation and has abdicated in his favour, when suddenly he hears the bugles heralding the arrival of the King. He dispatches his henchmen to the hunting lodge to find out what had gone wrong.Inside the cathedral, Rudolf comes face to face with Michael who stares at him as if seeing a ghost. The elder brother, as per custom, lends his arm to the younger brother to guide him to the throne.The Cardinal places the crown on the kings head. He stands up with his sword held aloft and recites his rehearsed speech about defending the realm against all enemies etc. While Rudolf is reciting the rather longish speech, the Colonel and David listen most anxiously with bated breaths and exhale a sigh of relief as he completes the speech without faltering.Then princess Flavia walks to the throne down the long corridor, flanked on both sides by courtiers, kneels down before the king and swears allegiance. Rudolf lifts her up by the shoulders, they momentarily stand side by side and then start to walk out of the cathedral to the waiting royal carriageUnsure of himself, Rudolf falls back on small talk, \"Well, I think it all went off very well, dont you, for a coronation. Of course, I mean, that is, a coronation should go well, if a king puts in an appearance, properly dressed and looks his part.\"\"And sober.\"\"Well, that was a nasty one. By the way among my Many other failings, I rather neglected you, didnt I.\"\"Two picture post cards in three years, I think.\"\"And all the time youve been changing into the loveliest princess in Europe. No, the loveliest girl in Europe.\"\"Your dynastic obligations to the princess royal dont compel you to make pretty speeches to her in private.\"Rudolf, pointing to the teeming crowds on both sides says, \"You call this private.\"\"You really behaved and looked like a king today. Something, I confess, few of us expected of you.\"Arriving at the royal palace they both appear on the balcony to the adulations of the gathered subjects. And from there retreat to an inner room.\"I think wed better go out, theyre expecting.\"\"Dont go yet. Its such a relief to have you to myself for a moment. All day long Ive been on parade. Cheered at, waved at, stared at. Not a chance to say - - - .\"\"Say what?\"\"Its enough to make any man lose his head a bit. I am crowned king. I meet the loveliest, most beautiful woman - - - - \"\n\"That isnt what you used to say. You used to call me tow-headed scarecrow.\"\"No! I hope you slapped me.\"\"I did. And once I kicked you very hard.\"\"Where?\"\"In the garden.\"\"I deserved it. But I've reformed.\"\"Almost beyond recognition. You seem an entirely different person. I cant understand.\"\"Dont try. Just stand there and let me look at you.\"\"But once you really hurt me. Youve forgotten, havent you.\"\"What did I do?\"\"It was at my 14th birthday party and I thought I was grown up. Your father told you to dance with me. You said you wouldnt, that I was a beastly infant. And when he insisted, you pinched me all the time we were dancing and told me how gawky I was. I hated you.\"\"I should have been horse whipped.\"Rudolf keeps Michael waiting outside before he can come in to pay his feigned respects. Rudolf takes a few jibes at him including how he had enjoyed the bottle of wine Michael had sent for him to the hunting lodge. Michael takes leave.\"Rudolf please be careful, Michael hates you. If you wont think of yourself, think of me. All my life Ive known what my future had to be and I was resigned to it. And now I dont have to tell you how different it is.\"\"Forgive me Flavia, I have been unfair.\"\"I only want you to know how much your life means to your country.\"\"To my country?\"\"And to your friends.\"\"My friends?\"\"And to your cousin and, most loving servant.\"Flavia gets up to leave saying, \"I will see you tomorrow.\"Rudolf repeats sadly to himself tomorrow, knowing he would not be here tomorrow.Colonel says to Rudolf, \"let us hurry back to the lodge to bring back the king and bid you farewell.\" At the lodge they find that the king has been kidnapped and taken prisoner to prince Michaels Castle of Zenda.Rudolf now perforce becomes the king for more than one day.\"At the coronation ball, Flavia waltzing with Rudolf says You look troubled.\"\"I was only thinking there may never be another night like this, another waltz.\"\"We shall always waltz together, Rudolf.\"Rudolf sees the British Ambassador approaching. He knows the Ambassador and is worried he might recognize him. The Cardinal joins them and asks for a date for the wedding. Rudlof, unsure of when the king can be brought back, says, in six months time.\"Cardinal- that is rather a long postponement.\"Unable to reveal the real reason, Rudolf prevaricates, \"There's an old proverb your eminence. Something about crossing your bridges before you come to them.\"\"Ambasador If your majesty will examine that proverb, you will find how very difficult it would be to cross a bridge at any other time!\"Moving away the Ambassador tells his wife, did you notice how much the king resembles our young Rudolf. Not at all - a typical wifely response. Princess Flavia is most upset about the postponement and starts to leave the ball. Rudolf begs her to listen to him.\"I never could willingly do anything to hurt you.\"\"I still dont understand.\"\"Then will you believe this without understanding that I love you.\"\"Oh, is it true or do you say that because you must.\"How the king is rescued from the prison in Zenda is a long and tortuous tale of jelousy, treachery, loyalty and bravery, the last by Rudolf himself in no small measure. Not much unlike the twists and turns in our Indian films of that period.The king says to him, \"I want to tell my people what you have done for us but I am told this has to be kept secret. You could not have served me better, you have taught me how to be a king.\"\"Princess Flavia wants to see Rudolf before he leaves for England.\"\"Rudolf presents himself Your highness.\"\"I sent for you to thank you for the service youve done this kingdom and its king.\"\"I love you. With my whole heart and soul, I love you. In all else I have been an imposter, but not in that. From the first moment I saw you in the cathedral youve been the only woman in the world for me. As I stand now, I know there'll never be any other.\"\"It would have made no difference if Id known. It was always you and never the king.\"\"Come with me, I wont give you up. I wont let them stand in the way of our happiness.\"\"Theres a world outside. Our world. And a throne for you, a womans throne, in my heart.\"\"I want that.\"\"Oh my love, think. Youll be free. Free of all these cares and duties - - - - .\"\"He sees the expression on her face change and asks, what is it Flavia?\"\"I was born for these cares and duties, Rudolf, Help me to do what I was born to do. Help me to do what I must.\nBut how can I do that, I love you.\"\"If love were all you would have left the king to die in his cell. Honour binds a woman too, Rudolf. I must stay.\"-Khurshid Anwer-"

The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as \"the fairest in the land\" when Snow White's beauty surpasses her own. A prince passes by, hearing Snow White's singing, and falls immediately in love with her and her beauty. Witnessing this, the Queen summons her loyal huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, but he cannot bring himself to do so because of her innocence and beauty, and instead begs Snow White to run away into the forest and never return to the castle. The forest animals befriend Snow White and take her to a cottage, where seven dwarfs live. The dwarfs grow to love their unexpected visitor, who cleans their house and cooks their meals. But one day while the dwarfs are away at their diamond mine, the Queen arrives at the cottage disguised as an old peddler woman and persuades Snow White to take a bite of a poisoned apple, promising her it will make all her dreams come true. Snow White wishes for a reunion with the prince, takes a bite, falls into a deep sleep, and the peddler woman declares she's now the fairest in the land. The dwarfs, alerted by the forest animals, rush home to chase the witch away and she falls to her death, but they are too late to save Snow White. Thinking her dead, too, the dwarfs place Snow White in a glass and gold coffin in the woods and mourn for her. The prince, who had searched far and wide for Snow White, hears of Snow White asleep in the glass coffin and awakens her with love's first kiss."

        "sinopsis": "A screenplay entitled \"A Star Is Born\" is stamped with the words, \"Final Shooting Script,\" then opened to reveal the following story: Esther Blodgett returns one winter evening to her home, an isolated farmhouse in North Dakota, after seeing a movie with her little brother Aleck, which starred her screen idol, Norman Maine. Esther's Aunt Mattie disdains Esther's obsession with the movies, and her father and grandmother Lettie are surprised to hear that Esther wants to be a movie star. After Mattie berates her, Esther runs to her room in tears. Lettie then tells Esther of her own past dreams of coming across the country in a \"prairie schooner,\" and although she cautions Esther about the heartbreak that always comes to those who pursue their dreams, Lettie encourages Esther and gives her money to take a train to Hollywood. In Hollywood, Esther goes to Grauman's Chinese Theatre, where she steps in the footprints of Norman Maine. Esther naively expects to begin immediately as an extra, but she learns the depressing news that no extra has been signed by Central Casting in the past two years. When she is told that she has only a one in one hundred thousand chance to succeed, she replies that maybe she is that \"one.\" Esther makes friends with Danny McGuire, an out-of-work assistant director who lives in her rooming-house, and when he gets a job, they go to a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, where Norman arrives drunk with actress Anita Regis and then starts a fight with a persistent photographer. Danny gets Esther a job as a waitress at a party his director is giving. Norman arrives at the party following another drunken escapade, which his exasperated press agent, Matt Libby, has kept out of the newspapers. Anita catches Norman in the kitchen flirting with Esther, and after she breaks a plate over his head, Norman and Esther leave together. Although he invites her to his place to talk over her career plans, Esther refuses, and after he gives her a goodnight kiss, he asks her to wait a moment so that he can take one last look at her before she goes in. Norman then phones and awakens studio head Oliver Niles at nearly three in the morning to arrange for a screen test for Esther, whose sincerity and honesty he praises. After the test, Esther signs a contract, and she is soon transformed by posture and voice coaches, and makeup artists into \"Vicki Lester.\" Unable to find a suitable female lead for his next picture, Norman talks Oliver into using Esther, and she is a smash hit with the preview audience, who disparage Norman's performance. Norman and Esther celebrate at the Cafe Trocadero overlooking the city, where Norman tells Esther that she now can have anything in the world, but reveals that stardom has not made him happy and that he feels he has thrown his life away. Esther comforts him and tries to convinces him that it is not too late, and they hug. At a boxing match, Norman proposes marriage, and the couple marry quietly at a small town courthouse, which spoils Libby's plans to cash in on the publicity. Soon after their honeymoon trip in a trailer, Norman's contract is canceled, and he is relegated to the role of house husband, while Esther becomes a top star. Norman starts drinking again, and during the Academy Awards ceremonies, he drunkenly interrupts Esther's acceptance speech for the award for finest performance by an actress and accidentally slaps her in the face. Sometime later, at Esther's instigation, Oliver visits Norman, now in a sanitarium, to offer him a role in a picture, but when Norman learns that it is not the lead, he good-naturedly declines. During Christmas week, Norman, out of the sanitarium and on the wagon, visits Santa Anita Racetrack, where he runs into Libby. Although Norman tries not to get riled as Libby brutally razzes him, when Libby crudely suggests that he is sponging off his wife, Norman hits Libby, who belts him. Norman then orders a bottle of scotch, and four days later, Esther learns that he has been arrested for crashing his car into a tree while intoxicated. Through Esther's pleading with the judge, Norman is released to her custody, but the newspapers make the incident into a front-page story. At their beach house in Malibu, Norman overhears Esther tell Oliver that she must now quit the movies so that she can go away with Norman. After Oliver leaves, Norman finds Esther crying. He tells her that he is going for a swim, and before he leaves her, he asks, as he did the night they met, for one last look at her. He then walks into the ocean and drowns. Outside the church where Norman's funeral is held, the uncaring comments and actions of Esther's fans cause her to scream hysterically. She is about to leave town, when Lettie arrives and convinces her that tragedy is a test and that she must not run away from herself. Later, as Esther is about to be interviewed on radio at a premiere in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, she sees Norman's footprints and starts to swoon, but she recovers and says with pride into the microphone, \"Hello, everybody. This is Mrs. Norman Maine.\" The last page of the screenplay, which contains the above line, is shown, and the screenplay is closed."

        "sinopsis": "** CONTAINS SPOILERSSophisticated, fun-loving couple, GEORGE and MARION KERBY, drive to New York for the annual board meeting of the bank at which George is a stock-holder. Arriving the night before, George and Marion - always up to a good time - go out on the town, dancing and frolicking the night away. As dawn arrives, they pull up to the bank, catching a snooze in the car's front seat, startling the PASSERSBY...another wild night for the carefree, happy Kerbys!Meanwhile, COSMO TOPPER, the bank's chairman, begins another regimented day, plucked from the shower by his efficient, sarcastic butler, WILKINS, who guides Topper through his morning routine, announcing the time at intervals. Topper goes down to breakfast, joining wife CLARA, who monitors her husband's life closely, draining it of all spontaneity. A good sport thus far, Topper tolerates her meddlesome plans with a bemused sense of husbandly duty.The board meeting goes off as scheduled, even though George Kerby arrives in the nick of time, having awoken in the car at the last minute. Bored Marion shows up in Topper's office later, gently teasing Topper, who's clearly smitten with her bold, prankish style, even though he's too restrained to admit it. Later, as George and Marion race home from the meeting, George loses control of the car, and they crash. Crawling out of the rubble, George and Marion realize they are transparent...they're becoming spirits! But George wonders why there are no \"trumpets,\" no formal prelude into heaven, and it's Marion who suspects that they might be expected to perform good deeds as a way of earning entrance through the pearly gates. Suddenly, George and Marion watch themselves as they vanish entirely, now genuine ghosts!Topper is depressed after the Kerbys' death, and wife Clara notices his mood. When the Kerbys' car is restored, purchased by Topper, he goes for a ride by himself, attracted by its speed and snazzy elegance. But suddenly Topper can hear the voices of George and Marion, and indeed they appear before the amazed banker, explaining that they have a short supply of ectoplasm and can therefore only appear for brief intervals. They ask the bewildered Topper to drive them to their penthouse, where Topper imbibes, blissfully free of his wife's control. When he passes out, Marion decides that Topper û whom she suspects is much more fun-loving than he appears -- is their way into heaven: If they can bring some joy and spontaneity to his life, perhaps they'll get through the pearly gates.The invisible Kerbys lead an inebriated Topper through the lobby, startling everyone they pass. When a melee develops in the street, Topper is arrested for being drunk and disorderly, brought before a JUDGE, who fines him one-hundred dollars. Clara reads about the incident in the paper. Horrified, she upbraids her husband for the whole affair, certain that their social life is ruined. On the contrary, Clara is later surprised when the incident inspires several social invitations, their friends delighted by the stuffy Topper's apparent new spontaneity.Topper goes to work, where everyone grins at him, delighted by his new image. Marion shows up in his office, gently teasing Topper and kissing him on the cheek, telling him she wants an ice cream soda. A delighted but embarrassed Topper escorts the invisible Marion from the office, startling his staff with the inexplicable appearance of lipstick on his cheek. When Topper takes Marion to a dress salon, she creates havoc, and Topper, embarrassed, sneaks away, leaving her behind. At home, Clara finds one of the lacey items Topper was going to buy for Marion, and she's jealous, leading to a fight. Topper decides to move out, packing his bags and leaving in the car.Marion appears in the car beside him, suggesting they head for the elegant Seabreeze Hotel. There, they check in, but the sight of a pen moving on its own draws the attention of a sour HOUSE DETECTIVE, who proceeds to monitor their every move. When he hears Marion's voice from Topper's room, the Detective alerts the MANAGER, but after searching Topper's suite, they can find no evidence of a woman, since Marion, delighted by the ruse, has vanished.Meanwhile, George Kerby arrives at Topper's house, looking for Marion. Annoyed with the whole affair, he chides Clara Topper for being so controlling of her husband, then sets out to find Marion. At the hotel nightclub, Topper decides he wants to dance with Marion, but when George shows up, he gets into a spat with his wife. The House Detective, observing all, confronts them, shocked when both George and Marion vanish. Their ghostly antics create mayhem on the dance floor.George and Marion make up, but Marion still wants to help Topper. After getting rid of the House Detective by distracting him with a dog, as well as eluding COPS, the trio take off, racing away in their car. Another crash ensues, and Topper, banged up as he is, assures the Kerbys that he has no intention of returning to his dreary, overly ritualized life with Clara. But Topper passes out, waking up at home, telling a NURSE that he wants to see Marion, even though the confused Nurse has no idea who Marion is. Outside, George and Marion prepare for heaven, hoping their good deed with Topper is sufficient for entrance. George has even stopped drinking. And indeed, a contrite Clara, happy that her husband is all right, holds him gently in his arms, determined to be a less controlling, more fun-filled wife. Topper is delighted by the change, and the Kerbys, waving goodbye from the window, prepare for the pearly gates..."

        "sinopsis": "Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), a famous actress, receives a surprise visit from Guy (George Curzon), a husband she hasn't seen in eight years. Guy reminds her he \"dragged her out of the gutter to make her a star\". He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \"silly Reno divorce\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who mistakenly think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the hostile crowd that has gathered, none believe him. At first Tisdall is confident that it's all a misunderstanding.After an overnight interrogation at the police station, it's established that he knew Christine and is struggling economically, so his motive seems to be £1,200 left to him in her will. Robert faints, and is revived by Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam) the attractive young daughter of the Chief Constable, Colonel Burgoyne (Percy Marmont). She seems quite at ease in ordinary male company, talking back vigorously to make her points or get her way.Saddled with a hopelessly incompetent and greedy barrister named Briggs (J.H. Roberts), Tisdall believes his innocence will never be proven, as the claim that his raincoat was stolen at a lorry station a few days ago is not believed. As he is about to go on trial, he escapes from the crowded courthouse corridor by donning his defense lawyer's glasses, then stows away in Erica's dilapidated Morris automobile. A reporter with a camera (Alfred Hitchcock) is at the steps of the court house and spots Tisdall escaping, but takes no notice.Robert explains his situation to Erica and vows to recover the lost raincoat, identify the real killer and prove his innocence. At first, Erica doesn't believe Tisdall is innocent, but she is attracted to the young man, so she continues to help him elude capture and search for the stolen coat that might lead to the real killer. She drops him off at an abandoned mill so he can hide out.At dinner at home, Erica's brothers discuss the suspect's escape, his need for money, sleep, and food to stay on the run.The next day she brings him food, a bit of money, and they have a talk in depth which changes her attitude towards him. \"I can laugh because I'm innocent,\" he tells Erica. \"You don't believe me. I wish you did.\" After eating, Robert nonchalantly flips a wrapper through a broken window at the precise moment that local foot policemen happen to glance in that direction. Two policemen come into the mill, and Erica and Robert must rush off in the Morris. They are spotted together, so the police suspect she is his accomplice.During their flight, they stop at the home of Erica's aunt, where her seven-year-old daughter Felicity is having a birthday party. Erica enters alone, planning to just call her father and check in, but she is dragged into the party. Uncle Basil (Basil Radford) arrives and finds Robert waiting outside and brings him inside, assuming he is Erica's beau. Aunt Margaret (Mary Clare) becomes suspicious. Just as they get away in the Morris, Margaret calls her brother Chief Constable Burgoyne, who in turn alerts police to be on the lookout for them.Their search takes them to \"Tom's Hat\", the diner where the raincoat was stolen, where they learn that a china mender known as Old Will got a new raincoat recently, and that he hangs out at a lodging named Nobby's. Erica's attitude ends up triggering a brawl and Robert needs to rescue her.They find Nobby's, Robert changes into seedy clothes, enters and asks about Old Will, after leaving Erica to sleep in the car hidden behind the freight train, as she can't stay awake any more.The next morning, in the lodging house full of snoring vagrants, dead cockroaches, and peeling paint, Tisdall finally meets the colorful hobo named Old Will (Edward Rigby). After hearing the story retold, Will agrees to help them find the man who gave him the garment, a stranger with noticeably twitching eyes who presumably is the murderer.Erica's dog, meantime, has smelled that Will is actually wearing the raincoat in question, three layers down from the outer one.Police cars come chasing, and they succeed in losing them by crossing railroad tracks in the nick of time before two long trains block the way, and a huge trailer truck further delays them at the gate beyond.They attempt to hide by driving into an abandoned mine, where the Morris starts to sink into tunnels below, and Erica has to be pulled to safety by one hand by Robert in the nick of time. The police find the mine, Robert flees but Erica is caught. She is brought to her father who is about to tender his resignation over the incident.That night, after she has a serious talk with her father, who shows her a letter of resignation, she is in her bedroom when Robert comes in the window, and she rushes to hug him. He tells her lovingly that he will turn himself in, shortly, to spare her anguish and relieve her conscience. As they talk, he learns that in a pocket of the coat, matches from the Grand Hotel have been found, a place where Tisdall has never been.Together they decide that's a last clue worth pursuing. Erica will take Will there to see if the twitchy eyed man may still be around, and Robert will find his own way there independently.Old Will dresses up in a new uncomfortable morning coat in order to infiltrate the hotel with Erica, but spotting a man with a twitch in the large crowd proves impossible.In a memorable sequence, the camera moves forward through the hotel lobby to the ballroom and the dancers to finally focus on the drummer in a dance band performing in black-face.... and his eyes twitch.The drummer, Guy, recognizes Old Will in the audience, and seeing the policemen, unaware that they are there to arrest Tisdall, the man performs poorly due to increasing nervousness and fear, to the point he is berated by the musical conductor. Guy proceeds to have a breakdown, precipitated by a drug he takes to excess to try to control the twitching. He begins banging drums and cymbals out of syn-ch, helplessly falling over the instruments, and passes out while the other musicians stare at him.Just then, the police have found Robert and Old Will and Erica, and are escorting them out. As hotel staff ask around to find medical help for Guy, Erica offers her experience, and the police, who know her, allow her to approach the unconscious Guy. As Erica tends to him, his eyes twitch, she realizes who he might be. Immediately after being revived, Guy confesses his crime and laughs hysterically. The police drag him away, cackling maniacally.In the final scene, Robert Tisdall and Erica Burgoyne are united. Her father arrives and seems happy to shake his hand, as if welcoming him into the family.THE END"

        "sinopsis": "ALEXANDER NEVSKYIn the 13th century, Russian lands suffer from foreign invasions. The opening shows an undulating field with relics of a battle: moldering uniforms, human skulls with helmets and a horse's skeleton.In 1242, attacks come from the East by Mongols and from the West by Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire.The first sight of Alexander (Nikolai Cherkasov) is as a fisherman.A courier arrives with news that neighboring Pskov has been conquered by Teutonic knights.A mongol governor in an impressive carriage escorted by soldiers approaches.Soldiers force the fishermen to kneel and answer questions.When the soldiers consider the attitude of a young fisherman insolent, they whip him and a skirmish starts, but stops as Alexander approaches.Alexander was known to the Mongols for having chased a Swedish army away.The mongol ruler is looking for Alexander to propose for him to join his forces with the rank of captain.Nevsky diplomatically refuses and replies: \"Die in your homeland, don't leave it\".He intents to fish, build ships and trade.Nevsky warns his followers that the Germans are a more dangerous enemy.The scene shifts to Novgorod, busy with trade, the last unconquered city in Russia.A pretty maid Olga (Vera Ivashova) is shopping for fabrics. Two friends who have recently fought in battle, Vasily and Gavrilo (Nikolai Okhlopkov and Andrei Abrikosov) are looking at weapons made by Ignat, a Master Armorer (Dmitriy Orlov).They talk about wanting a peaceful life with a wife and family, and recognize Olga.They are both attracted to Olga, and Gavrilo approaches speaks to her asking permission to send a matchmaker to her father.Gavrilo is serious and devoted, while Vasili is jolly and garrulous.Vasily says he is just as interested, and asks Olga to choose between the two, but she smiles and says she needs time to think it over.In the square in front of the church, a wounded warrior speaks to the crowd, giving news of the conquest of neighboring Pskov by the Germans, and telling of their bloody oppression.More inhabitants join the crowd as various individuals give speeches.Rich merchants want to purchase their liberty, but the common people want to resist.Olga, Gavrilo, and others say they want Alexander as their leader to fight.Despite opposition from the boyars and merchants of Novgorod, urged on by the monk Ananias, the crowd in Novgorod to decides to battle the invaders.Visitors from Pskov are present and wholeheartedly approve.It is arranged for emissaries, led by Gavrilo to call on Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had led the battle against the Swedes, to organize a defense.Nevsky is busy with fishing when the emissaries arrive.He first asks to be dressed in his prince costume, and receives the envoys.He agrees to lead, but not for defense, as he prefers to attack.He takes charge with the condition they all fight for Russia and not for themselves.\nPutting aside petty differences and issues, an army is raised from peasant volunteers. The scene shifts to Pskov.Pskov is burning, conquered with the help of the traitor Tverdilo.The marauding occupation forces distribute the loot.The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order (Vladimir Yershov) speaks: a blond, cold, arrogant man of regal bearing and extreme pride.The teutonic knights feel invincible and have just a smug smile for the Russian women who witness helplessly how their fathers and sons are killed at the least sign of resistance.When a prominent Pskov elder speaks in protest, he is bound in ropes.\nBefore he is led to hang over the large fire, his daughter Vasilisa ( Aleksandra Danilova) pleads for his life but she is yanked off him and he is led to his death.As punishment for resistance offered, children are ripped from their mothers arms and thrown in the fire while high dignitaries of the church look on.Back in Novgorod, Nevsky arrives, and the inhabitants promise to make weapons and armor for a thousand fighters.Vasilisa puts on a helmet and armor.In scenes at the invaders camp, the invaders attend religious services and boast of wanting to bait the \"russian bear\".On the Russian camp, Nevsky's plans are described. He decides to battle on the ice.His men know the territory but the Germans, who are heavier, will break through the ice...Olga promises to marry whoever proves the most valiant of her two suitors, each of whom is given command of an important sector. The night before the battle, the Russian troops gather on shore, and the old man tells a funny fable about how a hare trapped a wolf.In the battle with the Germans, Nevsky uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice as well as his experience of their military tactics to defeat them.Batle scenes follow: masterful, repetitive, with people advancing, swinging weapons around, people riding horses, people getting bopped on heads, some arrows flying. The Germans have heavier steel weapons, and more horses but the Russians have poles, hooks and axes of greater reach.Closeups of the battle concentrate on Vasily, Gavrilo, a blond youth, an old man, and Vasilisa, who come to rescue each other from time to time.Wave after wave of advancing Germans are defeated, so they regroup and move in again.After some give and take, the entire German fighting force forms a sort of fort surrounded by a shield wall, and sallies from the inner protected area take a heavy toll on the Russians.In a wedge attack, Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, the fight continues inside the formerly protected area, and when attacked in a pincers movement from outside, they are forced to regroup and mass towards the West side of the lake, where the ice is thinner.The turning point of the battle comes when Gavrilo battles single handedly against the Grand Master, a duel with ordinary fighters from both camps surrounding and watchingThe old man who came to the battle is killed by treachery by Tverdilo after feigning surrender, and only because his iron shirt was too short and the knife pierced him in the open part of his neck.In the disordered rout of the Germans, most knights are killed or drowned as the thin ice cracks and breaks. At the end of the battle, heaps of corpses are plunged in cosmic light under an endless horizon.At nightfall, Olga and other women search with torches for survivors.A devoted falcon sits on his master's dead body while a crow waits for the right moment to pick out the eyes of the deceased. The song after the battle as Olga is looking for her suitors is emotionally devastating.Olga finds Vasily and Gavrilo, wounded and unable to walk without help, and holds them up as they walk very slowly back.In the early morning, victors and vanquished file into the walled area of the town, first the dead, then the prisoners, and finally the victors\nSlain heroes are conveyed on sleds, burning candles in their hands.The most striking is the blond youth, shown on the screen in profile from head to hands.The wind is blowing and his blond hair is dancing in the wind, in tune with the flicker of the candle flame. At the end, Nevsky displays his generosity, as he pardons and frees the foot soldiers and keeps the knights as prisoners for ransom.Only the bearded traitor Tverdilo and a traitorous cleric who played organ are turned over to the mob.We see the gloomy faces of the angry Russians who had lost their relatives in the battle, and when they start tearing the traitor apart.The trials have ended. The time for celebrations arrives.Vasily publicly states that neither he nor Gavrilo was the bravest in battle: that honor goes to Vasilisa, and that after her came Gavrilo.Vasilys mother (Varvara Massalitinova) objects that her son has never been second to anyone, but Vasily respectfully insists.Gavrilo and Olga are united, while Vasily chooses Vasilisa as his bride to be, with her consent amply expressed in body language, and his mother acquiescing with broad smiles.Nevsky gives a final warning: He who comes to Russia with sword in hand will die by the sword."

        "sinopsis": "In the 1938 edition of \"The Big Broadcast\" series, the plot involves a transatlantic race from New York City to Cherbourg, France between a new steamship, the S.S. Gigantic, and the S.S. Colossal. Radio M.C., Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope) is in jail because he cant pay alimony to his three former wives. Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour), a potential fourth Mrs. Fielding, bails him out with money she got from hocking her engagement ring.\nT. Frothingill Bellows (W.C. Fields) intends to send his brother S.B. (also W.C. Fields) on the Colossal because he causes disasters wherever he goes. S.B. and his daughter, Martha (Martha Raye), end up on the Gigantic instead (there are a couple of W.C. Fields vaudeville-type comic golf routines; in the second one, his golf cart flies to catch the ship, but it lands on the wrong one). Buzz Fielding is onboard the Gigantic to broadcast reports of the transatlantic race and to M.C. the various musical acts that entertain on the ship and those listening on their home radios. Also aboard are Buzzs three alimony-seeking ex-wives, Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Dorothy Howe), and Dorothy, his current flame. The first performance on the ship is by Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm (themselves), who play \"This Little Ripple Had Rhythm\" for a cartoon sequence.\nNext, Buzz introduces the Mexican singer of operatic and Mexican popular songs, Tito Guizar (himself), who performs two numbers: \"Don't Tell a Secret to a Rose\" and \"Noche de Ronda.\"\nGrace, one of Buzzs former wives, distracts S.B. Bellows, while Dorothy brings food to the inventor of the ships power source, Bob Hayes (Leif Erikson). They are quickly attracted to each other and sing \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart.\"\nAt this point in the race, the Colossal is fifty-one miles ahead.\nThe next performance is opera diva Kirsten Flagstad (herself) singing \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from Richard Wagners music drama Die Walkure.\nThat exalted performance is followed by a comedy routine titled \"Honey Child,\" which precedes Dorothy's reprisal of \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart.\" Her song is followed by a comedy routine by Martha Bellows.\nWhen Buzz and Cleo meet in the ships bar, he is depressed, so she tries to cheer him up. In the films most famous scene, Buzz and Cleo reminisce about their life together as husband and wife; the song reveals that they still have feelings for each other. They perform \"Thanks for the Memory\" in a half-spoken, half-sung delivery. (Leo Robin's tongue-in-cheek lyrics are a catalog of questionable thanks.)\nDorothy accidentally helps Bob fix the ships power source, so it speeds forward closing the Colossals lead.\nNext, comes another W.C. Fields comedy routine; this one is about playing pool, followed by Martha singing \"Mama, That Moon Is Here Again,\" which includes a comic acrobatic dance.\nBuzz and Cleo perform \"The Waltz Lives On,\" which develops into a production number that includes examples of the waltz, polka, can-can, an African tribal dance, a cakewalk (\"At a Georgia Camp Meeting\"), the Charleston (\"Charleston\"), and swing. Martha sings \"Truckin' (They're Going Hollywood in Harlem)\" as part of the swing section. Then in a rather abrupt ending, the Gigantic catches and passes the Colossal. Buzz and Cleo get back together, while Dorothy and Bob become a couple."

        "summary": "Stan, who has remained faithfully at his World War I post for twenty years, finally comes home where his best friend, Ollie, takes him in, thus allowing him to discover the many conveniences of the modern world.",
        "sinopsis": "The film opens in 1917, while Ollie and Stan are serving in World War I. Their unit is engaged in trench warfare in Cootie Avenue, France. When the unit receives orders to attack the enemy lines, Stan is ordered to stand guard at their trench until relieved from duty. Stan is not pleased to stay alone, but Ollie promises to return for him.In 1918, the unit (and Ollie) are engaged in numerous battles and have been re-positioned many times. They did not return to the old trench. An armistice is signed later that year. The unit soon returns to the United States, and takes part in victory parades. In 1938, twenty-years later, Stan still stands guard over the trench in Cootie Avenue. He thinks the war is still ongoing, as he has yet to receive newer orders. He does not know that the world has forgotten about him. He wears his worn-out uniform and boots, and feeds every day with canned food.When an aircraft passes over the trench, Stan shoots at it with a machine gun. The pilot has to land the aircraft, and then searches for whoever shot at him. After a brief conversation between them, Stan finally learns that the war is over and leaves his trench. The scene shifts to Ollie, who has recently married. He is quite miserable, as his wife treats him as a servant and only pays him with a meager daily allowance (75 cents every day).She is currently angry with him, as he forgot their 1st marriage anniversary.Ollie asks his for an hour's leave from housework, in order to prepare a surprise for her. As he leaves their apartment, Ollie chit-chats with the sexy next-door-neighbor, Mrs. Gilbert. She is expecting her husband, big-game-hunter Mr. Gilbert, to return from a two-months long hunting expedition in Africa. The hunter returns and finds his wife holding hands with Ollie. He is quite irate and suspects that Ollie is hitting on his wife.Shortly after, a neighbor speaks to Ollie about the stupid war-veteran who guarded the trenches for twenty years. The neighbor shows the veterans newspaper photo to Ollie, who immediately recognizes Stan as his old comrade-in-arms. Following an elevator accident, Ollie borrows his wife's car and heads towards the veteran's home to meet Stan.At the veteran's home, Stan is wearing civilian clothes and trying to read a newspaper. He finds the available park bench uncomfortable, so takes a seat on an empty wheelchair. Ollie mistakenly believes that Stan has lost a leg, and the he is an invalid. During their first conversation in two decades, Ollie admits to having missed Stan. Ollie invites Stan to his home for a home-made dinner, and physically transports him to his wife's car.Ollie has problems with unparking the car, as there is a parked truck blocking the way. After realizing that Stan has two legs, Ollie instructs him to enter the truck and unpark it, Stan does manage to move the track, but in the process unloads its contents on Ollie's borrowed car. Damaging it.The scene shifts to Mr. Gilbert, who is bragging to press reporters about his past expeditions. He shows them his trophy collection, including a mounted boar's head from India, and elephant tusks from Africa. He killed every animal himself, and claims to have never missed a target yet.Ollie returns to his apartment building with Stan. Stan has a culture shock with the modern technology of the 1930s, such as automatic garage doors. Stan drives Ollie's borrowed car, in order to test the door himself. He exits safely and sees the door closing. He then drives forward, but the door fails to open. He collides the car into the garage door. Both the door and the car are destroyed.The elevator at the apartment building is out of order, so Ollie and Stan are forced to walk up to the 13th floor, where Ollie's apartment is located. They are unaware that the elevator's repair finished while they were still walking. By the time they get to the 10th floor, the duo are exhausted and stop for a rest. A man tries to walk down the stairs, and they unwittingly stand in his way. He hits them both with his walking cane, and starts a lengthy argument with Ollie.Ollie and the stranger agree to fight each other outside the apartment building. A crowd of spectators gathers to see the fight. The stranger tries to step away, as he is still in a hurry. Ollie dismisses him as a common coward, and the man angrily returns and starts hitting him. Besides his cane, he is using his suitcase. Some liquid starts pouring out of the suitcase. Ollie is knocked out and the crowd steps away. Later, Stan helps Ollie to get up and walks him back into the apartment building.Ollie is surprised to meet his ex-girlfriend Lulu at the apartment building. After a brief conversation, he tells her that he is now married to another woman. Lulu admits that she just left a love note for him, then hastily retreats. Ollie worries about his wife's reaction to Lulu's note. While walking upstairs in a hurry, Ollie is hit on the face with a ball, belonging to a neighbor boy. He angrily kicks the ball downstairs. Ollie is threatened by the boy's tough-looking father to retrieve the ball. Ollie does so, but Stan kicks the boy. When the boy complains that \"the guy\" kicked him, the father assumes it was Ollie and literally kicks Ollie's butt.As the tough father steps away, Stan kicks his butt from behind. The father thinks that Ollie kicked him, and kicks Ollie's butt again. Stan is angry, and punches the tough guy in the face. He knocks out the tough father with that single punch. Ollie kicks down the boy's ball again, and the boy does not dare to protest.Ollie finally opens the door to his 13th-floor apartment. His key jams in the door lock, and it linked with a chain to his pants. Ollie takes off his pants, to get inside. He sees too late that Stan managed to retrieved the key. Mrs. Gilbert exits her door, and sees Ollie in his underwear. They are both embarrassed, but Mrs. Gilbert hands over Lulu's love note. It was left in her apartment by mistake. Ollie is relieved. He is informed through a note that his wife has gone shopping, and that they have the apartment to themselves.Stan asks Ollie for a cigarette, but Ollie is a non-smoker. Stan next asks permission to smoke his own pipe. Soon the living room is full of smoke, and Stan himself has a coughing fit. Ollie destroys Stan's pipe. Mrs. Hardy soon returns, and is already angry with Ollie for his delay. When Ollie introduces Stan to her, Mrs. Hardy reminds Ollie that he is not allowed to bring friends home. She refuses to cook for them, and uses some insulting terms for Stan. The couple have a loud argument, and Mrs. Hardy packs her suitcase and leaves the apartment. Ollie regrets marrying her, and advises Stan to never get married.Stan wants to leave and return to the veteran's home, but Ollie insists that he can cook for his house-guest. Stan tries to light the gas stove with a match, and Ollie unwittingly helps him. Causing an explosion in the kitchen. Nobody is seriously harmed, but the apartment is damaged. Mrs. Gilbert politely offers to help out with cleaning it.While cleaning, Ollie accidentally spills liquids from the kitchen on Mrs. Gilbert's dress. She is soaking wet. She tries to return to her apartment and change clothes, but realizes that she forgot her keys. She is locked out of her apartment. With no women's clothing left in his apartment, Ollie lends her a pair of his own pajamas. She exits his bedroom, dressed with oversized pajamas.Ollie tries to get downstairs to ask for a spare key to Mrs. Gilbert's apartment, but sees Mrs. Hardy returning. He desperately tries to hide Mrs. Gilbert, because he fears that his wife will kills him if she sees another woman in his pajamas. Mrs. Hardy is angry about the condition of the apartment and interrogates Stan. She then attacks Ollie, because the car she borrowed to him is wrecked. They argue loudly, with Stan as a bewildered bystander.Ollie announces that he is going to leave the apartment to his wife. He and Stan attempt to covertly transport Mrs. Gilbert out of the apartment, while she hides in a large trunk. Mrs. Hardy kicks Stan's butt from behind. As the argument continues, Mr. Gilbert returns to his apartment and overhears the argument next-door. He attempts to intervene in the fight, and figures that Stan is a homewrecker. He angrily brags about intending to shoot anyone who could threaten his own marriage.When Mrs. Hardy steps away, Stan tells Mr. Gilbert that there is a woman in the trunk. Mr. Gilbert is amused, but advises Ollie to never bring mistresses home. He admits to cheating on his wife, but he does so when away from home. His wife overhears that confession, and angrily confronts him. Mr. Gilbert notices that she is wearing Ollie's pajamas, and figures that his wife is Ollie's mistress. As Ollie and Stan run away, Mr. Gilbert chases them with a loaded shotgun.,Mr. Gilbert starts shooting at the two men, but misses his moving targets. They get to the street outside, and Mr. Gilbert keeps on shooting. At the sound of the shots, half-dressed men hiding in nearby apartments start trying to escape. They are implied to be the lovers of the other women in the area. The film ends, as the chase continues."

Baby, in Susan's temporary care, is a gift from Susan's brother to their aunt Elizabeth (May Robson), who David hopes will make a large donation to his museum. David is about to marry Alice (Virginia Walker).David is piecing together a brontosaurus skeleton that is missing one bone (the fictitious intercostal clavicle), which Susan's dog, George (Asta from The Thin Man (1934)) steals and buries. David and Susan try to recover the bone and Baby, who got away. Meanwhile, a psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) believes that both of them are off their nut and have them put in jail. Susan escapes. While she's gone, George leads Baby to the jail. A few minutes later Susan comes back with a leopard at the end of a rope, not realizing that it is not Baby, but a dangerous circus animal (also played by Nissa the Leopard). George corrals the wild leopard in one of the jail cells and saves the day.Several weeks later, Susan finds David (who has been jilted by Alice because of her) working on his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After giving him the missing bone (which she found by trailing George), she tells him she has persuaded her aunt to make the large donation. Against his advice, Susan climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him. When the ladder starts swaying dangerously, she climbs onto the skeleton. Before it collapses, David grabs her hand. Surveying the wreckage of his work, David gives up and admits that he cannot live without her."

        "sinopsis": "Devastated that his fiance, radio singer Amanda Cooper, has broken their engagement for the third time, lawyer Stephen Arden shows up drunk at the office of psychiatrist Dr. Tony Flagg, his best friend, and begs him to psychoanalyze Amanda. Reluctantly Tony agrees to see Amanda, but while the singer is waiting for him in his office, she accidentally overhears one of his Dictaphone recordings in which he flippantly describes her as a dizzy, mindless female. Thus insulted, Amanda rebuffs Tony when they finally meet and leaves his office before the session has started. Later, Tony runs into Amanda, Stephen, Amanda's aunt Cora and Judge Joe Travers at the Medwick Country Club but is again snubbed by the singer. During an exhausting bicycle chase through the club park, Tony forces Amanda to reveal the reason for her anger and, after apologizing, tries to discuss her marriage phobia with her. Amanda, however, is unable to reveal the cause for her apprehension, and that night at dinner, Tony orders her a meal of \"dreaming\" food--outrageous combinations of rich dishes--to open up her subconscious. When Amanda still has difficulty falling asleep, Tony tells his assistant, Connors, to give her a sedative, which Cora then takes by mistake. Eventually Amanda falls asleep and dreams of an intensely romantic interlude between herself and Tony. The next day, however, Amanda shows up in Tony's office with Stephen and announces that their engagement is on again. Amanda then tries to tell Tony about her dream, but is so embarrassed by it that she makes up a convoluted, symbol-laden dream in which she is Little Red Riding Hood. Convinced that Amanda is a once-in-a-lifetime patient, Tony rushes to tell his colleague, Dr. Powers, about his discovery and prepares an injection of truth serum. After Amanda is injected, Stephen bursts into the examination room and informs her that she is late for a radio singing engagement. On the way to the studio, the drugged Amanda breaks a pane of glass and then insults the sponsor of the show on the air. When she then hits a policeman, she is arrested and brought before Judge Travers, who criticizes Tony's methodology but releases his patient. Later, Amanda admits to Cora that she loves Tony, but when she tries to break the news to Stephen, he assumes that he is the cherished man in question and immediately announces his engagement to a crowded restaurant. Amanda then tells Tony her true feelings, but out of loyalty for his friend, he submerges his emotions. Through hypnosis, he convinces Amanda that she loves Stephen and feels that the rest of manhood should be \"shot down like dogs.\" Now desperate to be with Stephen, Amanda rushes to the country club where he and Judge Travers are practicing their skeet shooting. Seeing the judge, Amanda grabs a skeet rifle and starts shooting blindly at him, while shouting to Stephen that she adores him. When Tony finally confesses to Stephen that Amanda is in love with him, Stephen accuses his friend of trying to steal his fiance and bars him from seeing her. On the eve of Stephen and Amanda's wedding, Tony connives with Connors to see Amanda alone, but his attempts to re-hypnotize her fail. At the wedding, however, Tony finds Amanda and, after first knocking out Stephen, knocks out Amanda and informs her subconscious that she really loves Tony. Cured at last of her marriage phobia, Amanda, black eye and all, walks down the aisle with Tony."

A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men wed teen or preteen girls.Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby, who drag her into the woods one night with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this however, Angelo the dwarf and Mr. Colton arrive with a shotgun to save the day.Following this, Jake Bolby spots young Jennie Colton swimming. When her father dies, he decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that he will see Jennie's mother hanged for murder otherwise.After he \"courts\" Jennie Colton by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this marriage was unlawful, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot.Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie, and the movie ends.This was one of director Harry Revier's final films. He had previously made a series of low-budget, independent movies including The Lost City series and Lash of the Penitentes.Child Bride became a public domain movie, and continues to be widely screened more than 70 years after it was first made.Even though it was not made by a major Hollywood studio, the movie is very skillfully produced and presented. Photography and actor work is done well, and the trailer (also in the public domain, and widely seen in recent times) is very skillfully done, and does a good job of selling the movie, and emphasizing it's interest and good qualities, acting, etc. The actor work of Shirley Mills is especially emphasized, and it is obvious she \"carried\" the movie importantly, was a real \"child movie star\" in Child Bride (1938)."

Scrooge gruffly refuses, considering Christmas a humbug, and although he gives his underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit the day off, he later fires him when the meek Bob mistakenly pelts him with a snowball. Bob does not tell his family, though, and buys the family's hoped for Christmas feast. The Cratchits are happy, though poor, with their one sorrow the health of Tiny Tim, their crippled youngest child. As the Cratchits and Fred enjoy Christmas Eve, Scrooge goes to his empty house where he is visited by the chained shade of Jacob Marley, Scrooge's late partner, who warns Scrooge that he must change his ways. He also tells Scrooge that three ghosts will visit him that night. Scrooge disdains Marley's words until their visits. The first, the Spirit of Christmas Past, shows him his lonely childhood, the second, the Spirit of Christmas Present, shows him the happiness of Fred and the Cratchits. The third, the Spirit of Christmas Future, reveals to Scrooge his own mourner-less death and the sadness following that of Tiny Tim. Though the shade does not speak, Scrooge pleads that he will change. When he awakens, he is a different man. He happily buys turkey and presents and gives generously to men collecting for the poor. He visits Fred and makes him his partner, then goes to the Cratchits' house where he gives them gifts, and promises Bob a raise. After vowing to keep the spirit of Christmas throughout the year, he makes the toast, \"To all of us, everywhere, a Merry Christmas to us all, my dears,\" and Tiny Tim adds \"God bless us, everyone.\""

After some time, the bulls have all grown up. However, age has not affected Ferdinand's 'philosophy.'One day, some men from the nearby town come to choose a bull for the bullfight. The other bulls eagerly parade their skills before the men. Ferdinand just watches, but as he tries to sit down in another spot, he accidentally sits on a bee. The sting of the little bee causes him to become spooked, and in his pain, he smashes a number of objects. This causes the men to choose him.Ferdinand is brought into the ring, but instead of fighting the bullfighter, he makes a beeline for a bouquet of flowers that had been thrown by a lovely senorita. The bullfighter tries to rile Ferdinand, and finally rips open his shirt. However, on his chest is a tattoo of a flower. Ferdinand nonchalantly gives it a pleasing lick, and the bullfighter final concedes defeat in a shower of tears.Ferdinand is then taken from the ring and returned to his tree, where he still continues to wile away the time, smelling flowers."

        "sinopsis": "Johann Strauss II was a gifted amateur composer who worked in a bank. Johann found that he was often distracted by the melodies in his head and would end up writing waltz instead of computing figures on company time. After he got fired, he decided to become a professional composer. Johann and a group of amateur musicians put together a small orchestra and had their début performance in a casino. It was a huge success, both inside and outside of the casino were filled with people dancing to his waltz. One of those people was Carla Donner - the star of the Imperial Opera. Carla liked Johann's music and invited him to play in her lover Count Hohenfried's party. Defying social protocols and tradition, Carla sang to Johann's waltz as a common dance hall singer, and Johann became the most sought-after composer. Having negotiated an unprecedented profitable contract with music publisher Hofbauer, Johann married fiancée Poldi and the couple settled down in a big house.To show his support of the democratic revolution, Johann wrote a march and led the demonstration. Along the way the crowds saw Carla's carriage parked outside the Count's mansion and was about to attack her - the symbol of the corrupted upper-class. Johann came to Carla's rescue and proclaimed her a fellow artist; thus, the Lady Liberty of their demonstration. This saved Carla for the time being, but their luck turned when the military police arrived to break up the demonstration, Johann and Carla were arrested.They managed to escape but couldn't go home as most streets were barricaded, the cab driver took them to the Vienna Woods to rest for the night. Next morning, on their way back to the city, the various sounds of human and animal activities inspired Johann. Together with Carla and the cab driver, he came up with a melody Carla named \"The Tale of the Vienna Woods\".In need of an orchestra collaboration to finish composing this new waltz, they found a country inn that has an orchestra and Johann went to work. Carla didn't go back to the city but stayed with him - the two had fallen in love. But Johann was interrupted by a mob of crowds - the revolution had ended, a new emperor, in support of a constitution, was now in power.Back to the city, Johann continued to produce beautiful music; while his relationship with Poldi was anything but. Johann had started an affair with Carla, and as the Imperial Opera commission him to write a new opera for Carla, the affair became known to everyone. Unaware of Johann's infidelity, a socially-awkward Poldi didn't attend the opening night performance. Count Hohenfried paid her a short visit and gave her the cruel news. Poldi took a gun and rushed to the opera house, just in time to see Johann and Carla together, showered with applause and adoration. Realising that she had already lost Johann to Carla, Poldi asked Carla to look after Johann, congratulated him and went home.As Johann and Carla were about to board the ship heading to Budapest, he found that he couldn't abandon Poldi. He said goodbye to Carla and stayed on the pier for the rest of the night, not wanting to go home. In the morning, the sound of water movements from the boats and the washwomen around him brought back the melody he and Carla came up with in the Vienna Woods. This time, he finished the waltz and changed the name to \"The Blue Danube\"."

        "sinopsis": "The Old Guard of 1852 New Orleans protectively circles its wagons. Bankers are concerned that Yankee abolitionists could eventually change the way their accounts will be processed. The health administrator keeps evacuating people living below the ever-adjusted yellow fever quarantine line.When Julie (Bette Davis) has to move up from her own mansion below the fever line to become a guest in her Aunt Belle (Fay Bainter)'s mansion, her interested beaux include Buck Cantrell (George Brent), a southern dandy rake, and Preston \"Pres\" Dillard (Henry Fonda), the most wooden of the old guard bankers who is on the committee to arrange that annual ball which soothes the senses of folks looking to maintain the old ways. Pres is so engaged in helping his bank react appropriately to perceived abolitionist Yankee threats that he is unable to drop by the dressmakers to approve the ball gown Julie is commissioning. Unaware of the purpose of the ball, and unaware that red is the biblical rainment of the fallen woman, - all the rest of the ladies at the ball will be wearing white frogs - Julie spitefully commissions a rather revealing red gown. Aunt Belle and the health administrator beg Pres to beat some sense into her. When Pres, who is, in his own way, as socially unaware of the world as is Julie, storms into Julie's room brandishing a cane, Julie jokingly interprets his behavior as she would that of any powerful, athletic man forcing himself into a lady's private bedroom brandishing a weapon. Pres decides then and there to rethink his assessment of Julie as his proper wife. At the ball, Julie is so flabbergasted to be shunned that she begs Pres to take her home. Pres, however, decides that it would be best to publicly announce their breakup in the presence of all of New Orleans Society. After Julie is humiliated into dancing with Pres, the other couples move off the floor and the orchestra is ordered to stop playing, leaving the couple isolated on the dance floor with everyone facing away from Julie.Some time later, Aunt Belle gives a ball to welcome Pres returning home from banking business up north to present Amy (Margaret Lindsay), his aristocratic Yankee wife. Julie dresses up in a white party gown which shows a lot of cleavage and could be that of a wedding. She bosses Zette (Theresa Harris) onto checking whether somebody has arrived, dressing her, going after her... Finally, Pres arrives in a carriage. After Julie's carefully rehearsed, staged and white-dress costumed act of contritely begging Pres for forgiveness is considered by Amy to be totally inappropriate, Julie makes a second faux pas in the presence of all New Orleans Society by publicly both seducing Pres and insulting Amy. Because Pres acquired no social skills at all while up north, he decides that now is the time to inform Julie that she and Amy will both be guests of Aunt Belle while he answers to call to help the health administrator readjust the yellow fever quarantine line. There is a discusion between several men as to the importance of cotton in the country's economy, and they bow to keep New Orleans as the biggest city in USA. The rest of the gathering is outraged when Pres predicts that new machinery will beat unskilled slave labour. Buck and Julie seem to mock Pres, saying that he's talking like a Yankee. Pres has succeeded as a banker, and has lost Southern routines. During the night's small gathering at their manor house, Julie asks Pres why he's married so fast, and he replies back that he's in love with Amy. Julie says that he must have needed to come back because, after all, he belongs to the South.Buck mocks Amy in front of Julie, but she is too upset about Pres' response. However, Buck comments about Cato make him look foolish and redneck. Julie makes Buck promise that he won't start any fight with Pres. Cannonball thunder is heard: it's the cannonballs which are being thrown in order to change the winds which are spreading the yellow fever. There is a small discussion about how the yellow fever could be better stopped, and Pres says he would advise the city hall to drain the moors, clean up the street and organize a better sewage system. Buck, General Bogardus (Henry O'Neill) and Belle disagree: Southern traditions are good enough for them, and they must be kept. At that moment, the black slaves appear to sing welcoming songs to the guests. Julie sits down on the porch to sing with them.Buck is soon killed by Pres' younger brother Ted (Richard Cromwell) in a duel over Julie. Julie had started it all, encouraging once against the other. Dr Livingston (Donald Crisp) tells Julie that now she's got what she's been fighting for. Julie tries to convince him to stop the duel, but he says that women can start fights, but that they can't put a stop to them afterwards. Later, Julie is organizing the buquets of flowers onto their vases with Zette like she's got no a care in the world, while Amy gets frantic, taking for granted that Ted will die in the duel. However, Ted arrives saying that Buck die knowing that Julie had used him. Aunt Belle warns Julie that the community's mutual sufferings because of her outrageous behavior has the town comparing her to the biblical Jezebel.The fever spreads. New Orleans has been sieged: nobody can enter or leave the town. Pres drinks alcohol - the only known healing to the yellow fever. Banks are also suffering, as the plague is causing communication problems, the blockade, commerce problems... Pres says that he's feeling bad to Dr Livingston. After knowing that Buck is dead, Pres has a fit. Only Dr Livingston dares to help poor Preston Dilliard, who has crumbled down. When news arrives that Pres has contracted yellow fever, Amy confronts Julie to take stock of what she's done. Finally admitting to herself that Pres hasn't given a damn about her since the day of the ball, Julie realizes that her possible redemption lies not with those who will always shun her, but with the home that she really owns and the man she really wants each trapped below the quarantine line. A slave brings the news that Pres is at Julie's home because no hotel wanted to accept Pres. The slave was able to cross the quarantine line by means of a stolen boat. While the rest of her and Pres' relatives search for a governor's permit to visit Pres, Julie uses the stolen boat. Julie arrives first. Livingston advises Julie not to see Pres, as the yellow fever is really contagious. Pres is delirious. Julie tends to him. Belle, Amy and Ted appear with a Governor's pass to visit Pres. Julie is there. Amy looks at her with jealousy and amazement, and in silence she takes Julie's place besides the sick man's bed. Julie leaves in silence as well, and goes down the stairs, sitting carelessly in a sofa. Livingston says that Julie should sleep some, or she'll have to join Pres. That gives an idea to Julie.Ted is indignant that Livingstone has denounced Pres, so he'll be taken away to the leprosery, but the doctor says that there cannot be a law for poor people and other for wealthy people. The ruthless army people arrive. So Julie convinces Amy that she will accompany Pres to the leprosery to the island where he'll be sent, as only Julie will be able to take care of him, terrorising the nurses and workers onto giving him the best medicines and care. Amy refuses af first, but then she accepts, when Julie admits that Pres only loves Amy, and not her. That way, Julie will pay her dues and make atonement for her sins.Everybody stares while Julie goes running after Pres. They are two more people among the sick destitute who will go to the leprosery, most of them to die. While this happens, cannonballs fly and there are bonfires in every crossroad of the city."

        "summary": "While travelling in continental Europe, a rich young playgirl realizes that an elderly lady seems to have disappeared from the train.",
        "sinopsis": "In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss Froy strike up a conversation. They leave the compartment together to go to the dining car for tea. On route to the dining car, Miss Froy stumbles into the compartment of the English couple the Todhunters and proffers her excuses. In the dining car, the pair are seated by a waiter and Miss Froy provides a supply of her own tea, Harriman's Herbal Tea. While in the dining car, Miss Froy writes her name in the dust of the window after Iris mishears it as Freud when the noise of another train drowns out their conversation. During tea, Miss Froy annoys the two English gentlemen returning to England for the test match by asking for their sugar cubes, which are being used to illustrate a cricket match. Miss Froy tells Iris about her job as a children's governess and music teacher. They reserve two places for the first sitting of lunch. After returning to the compartment, encouraged by Miss Froy, Iris drops off into a heavy nap.When she reawakens, the governess has vanished. Iris is shocked when the other passengers in the compartment, the Baroness (Mary Clare), and a grinning Italian (Philip Leaver), claim \"the English lady\" never existed. Even the other English travelers deny ever seeing her, for their own reasons: the Todhunters for fear of drawing attention to their affair, and the cricket fans Caldicott and Charters because they are worried about missing the cricket Test match if confirming the disappearance causes delays.A reknowned \"brain specialist\" on the train, Dr. Egon Hartz (Paul Lukas), suggests that Miss Froy never existed: Iris was bumped on the head before boarding, and the conversation may have only taken place in her mind. Dr. Hartz, declares that she must be hallucinating due to her accident. However, Iris is certain that something more sinister is going on and continues to investigate,.As she searches the second class carriages looking for Miss Froy, Iris meets Gilbert. Their earlier interactions back at the hotel had not been good, but he believes she is sincerely distressed and offers to help. Since the train had not stopped anywhere during her nap, Iris is convinced Miss Froy is somewhere in the train.At the first stop the train picks up a heavily bandaged brain tumor patient, carried on a gurney (a patient of Dr. Hartz) who is being transported to a hospital for surgery. Iris watches carefully on one side of the train, Gilbert on the other, and they see no one get off the train.After the train starts off again, Gilbert and Iris question all the people who should have seen Miss Froy, but they draw a blank until Mrs. Todhunter comes forward to say she has seen Miss Froy. She hopes that having her name made public will trigger a scandal, which would result in divorces for herself and her paramour. After this, the Italian from Iris's compartment appears and says that Miss Froy has returned. Iris and Gilbert return to the compartment to find someone dressed like Miss Froy seated there, however when her face is seen it is not Miss Froy. This lady is Madame Kummer (Josephine Wilson). The Baroness says she did not equate Iris's English nanny with this German lady. Gilbert announces that he can dispel the confusion as there is someone else on the train who has seen Miss Froy/Madame Kummer. Unfortunately while this has been going on, Mrs. Todhunter has told her lover what she has done. Mr. Todhunter says that while her husband would divorce her, his wife will never divorce him. With this in her mind, Mrs. Todhunter now identifies Madame Kummer as the same woman she saw wearing oatmeal tweeds early on.Feeling dejected, Iris takes Gilbert to the dining car. Gilbert tells Iris bits about his life. During this conversation, Iris notices Miss Froy's name fingered on the dust of the window just as they enter a tunnel. By the time they come out into the open, the name has disappeared. Iris becomes annoyed and frustrated at Gilbert's disbelief as she tells him about the Harriman's Herbal Tea package. Iris storms out of the dining car and pulls the emergency cord in desperation.After the train has restarted, and under the threat of being put off the train at the next stop, Iris returns to her compartment alone. Meanwhile, some rubbish has been thrown out of the dining car and a gaudy tea label for Harriman's Herbal sticks briefly to the window in front of Gilbert. This is enough to make him believe Iris and he rushes back to her. They embrace in the corridor. After this, they search the train and end up in the baggage car, where they find the broken glasses of Miss Froy among items that identify the Italian as \"The Great Doppo,\" a professional magician on tour, adept at making people disappear. The magician appears and he takes the glasses from Gilbert. A struggle ensues, and the magician even draws a switchblade. But with some help from Iris, they knock the magician unconscious and put him in a trunk, and tie a rope around it. Unbeknownst to them, the trunk is a magician's trick trunk and the Italian makes his escape.After this, they head off to tell all of this to the one person they think they can trust, Dr Hartz. They open the door of his compartment but he is not there, only the heavily bandaged patient and the nun nurse.Iris notices that the nun with the patient is wearing high heels, which means she is in disguise. Iris surmises that Miss Froy was lured to the baggage car and held captive. Madame Kummer, who wasn't seen boarding the train, must have come aboard disguised as the patient, dressed in clothes like Miss Froy's, with Miss Froy becoming the bandaged patient. Dr. Hartz returns and tells them to wait in the next compartment while he orders the nun to arrange for drinks to be drugged, as one waiter is an accomplice. He takes them to the dining car, and urges them to drink the brandies he has ordered to calm their nerves. When they return to the compartment, he tells them the patient is Miss Froy and she will be taken off the train at the next station. She will be taken to a hospital, where he will perform an operation from which she will not recover. He also tells them that the drinks they have just had have been drugged. Iris and Gilbert then seem to go to sleep due to the drug.Dr. Hartz leaves the compartment to get ready to get off at the next station. But the drug hasn't taken full effect yet, and Gilbert and Iris have heard that they can fight this particular drug's drowsiness by a lot of physical activity. Gilbert climbs out of the window and into the compartment where the nun and Miss Froy are. The nun speaks perfect English and tells Gilbert that she was hired to play a part but is unwilling to help in a murder. They unwrap Miss Froy from her constraining bandages. At this point Madame Kummer enters, so they bandage her up in Miss Froy's place against her will. Gilbert and Miss Froy return to the next compartment and pretend to be still asleep because of the drug.At the following stop, Dr Hartz, the patient, and the Baroness leave the train and board a waiting ambulance. With the train still at the station, the identity of the patient is discovered. Dr Hartz arranges for a station worker to uncouple the rear cars, so when the engine starts off again, only the first class car and the dining car are pulled out and they are diverted away from the border. After the train pulls off, pleased that they will soon be over an international border, Gilbert notices that the back of the train has been uncoupled and goes back to tell the others. They agree that there is only the carriage they are in and the dining car between them and the engine but that there wouldn't be anyone there right now. Gilbert points out that it is teatime so all the English people will be there. The three of them go to the dining car. At first no one believes that the train has been uncoupled. Just as they confirm this, the train stops in a wood, and they see cars waiting, uniformed people in them. Dr. Hartz and the Baroness (she is wife to the Minister of Propaganda) are seen with the cars.A military officer approaches the train and politely tells the English group to get off the train so they can be escorted to safety. The nun warns Gilbert of a trap and he clobbers the officer with a chair, and he falls unconscious. Charters thinks this is very rash, and says he is going to go out to apologize and \"put things right.\" But a dining car steward has already told the officials of the attack. The Baroness gives an order and one of the soldiers shoots Charters in the hand. Gilbert takes the officer's revolver, and challenges the approaching officials. Mr. Todhunter also has a pistol. Gilbert and Caldicott (who Charters says is \"a damn good shot\") start firing, in response to attacking shots. Mr. Todhunter goes outside waiving a white handkerchief in truce and is shot by the attackers. While this is going on, Miss Froy reveals to Iris and Gilbert that she is taking a message: a tune to take to a Mr. Callender at the Foreign Office. Gilbert promises that he can memorize Miss Froy's tune quickly because of his musical training. Miss Froy leaves and is seen in the distance dropping behind a rise after a shot is fired towards her.When they run out of ammunition, Gilbert decides that they need to get the train started, head back to the junction, switch the points, and get across the border. He and Caldicott head to the engine while Charters will, at the right moment, jump down and switch the points. They force the engine crew to start the train and head back to the junction. Both crew are shot by the soldiers, but luckily Gilbert once \"ran a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line.\" The unconscious officer has recovered, and is holding the passengers at gunpoint, but the nun manages to sneak out to change the points. After she throws the switch, and is scooped up by Gilbert in the nick of time, she is shot in the leg by Dr. Hartz, who has pursued them in one of the cars from the woods.On arrival at Victoria station, London, they all go their separate ways. Sadly for Caldicott and Charters, the Test match has been abandoned due to flooding. On seeing her fiancé coming to greet her, Iris hides in a cab, pulls Gilbert in with her, and says she wants to marry Gilbert instead. They continue on to the Foreign Office. On arriving there, in the excitement of their feelings for each other, Gilbert has forgotten the tune. After a few unsuccessful attempts to refresh his memory they hear the tune being played on a piano, and walk into the next room to see Miss Froy playing it. It is the same tune the balladeer strangled at the hotel had been playing. Iris and Gilbert approach Miss Froy. She looks up to see them both, and grasps their hands joyfully."

Finally, it shows Marie-Antoinette growing into dignity and maturity as she separates from her sweetheart, a dashing Swedish aristocrat (Tyrone Power), and supports her husband through the crisis of the monarchy, following him to prison and death."

        "sinopsis": "In ancient Egypt, Neferus is buried alive after his lover Anebi, the pharaoh's daughter, causes his downfall. Three thousand years later at Olympia Museum in Los Angeles, Professor Dean Lambert, who happens to be the spit and image of Neferus, studies the sarcophagus of his double, translating his history tablet by tablet. Dean is convinced that falling in love will ruin him as it did Neferus. Then he meets aspiring actress and heiress Jane Van Buren and exchanges clothes with her drunk audition partner, Snoop Donlan. Dean is arrested for stinking of liquor. His arrest makes the papers and he is asked to resign from the museum staff. Dean has ten days to join an expedition leaving for Egypt from New York and becomes a stowaway in the trailer of a pair of newlyweds bound for Niagara Falls. Snoop then accuses Dean of stealing his watch and clothes. Jane, meanwhile, follows the trailer in order to return Dean's clothes and the museum's car. The newlyweds kick Dean out, while the police trail him on suspicion of robbery and jumping bail. Jane then finds Dean and urges him to clear himself, but he insists on continuing toward New York and she agrees to drive him. While fleeing the police, Jane and Dean camp in the desert, and he falls in love and kisses her. The kiss causes a storm to break, just like the story of Neferus and Anebi. Dean is struck by lightning and begins speaking in a strange language. The next day, he leaves Jane a note saying that \"Death lies ahead\" if they continue their romance. After many adventures, Sheriff Sweat of Springville, Pennsylvania, finally apprehends Dean, but Jane picks him up in the museum car, which is discovered by the police. A chase ensues. While hiding in the woods, the couple discusses the eighth tablet of Neferus, which says \"marriage.\" After hopping a refrigerator car, the couple is brought before a kindly judge, who dismisses the charges brought against them so that they can marry. The papers print that Jane is to marry a hobo. Although reluctant to make his bad luck worse, Dean marries Jane in New York, but then must face her father, who accuses him of being a fortune hunter. Dr. Ellison, head of the expedition, gives Dean a fake missing fragment of the ninth and last tablet for a wedding present, which Jane has inscribed with the story of Neferus saving Anebi from her father, who has abducted her. Dean boards what he believes is the Van Burens' yacht and fights for his bride, destroying the yacht, to the delight of Van Buren, who now accepts him. Jane then realizes Dean fought for her knowing the tablet was fake. The couple is united and, years later, as an old man, Dean finally finds the real ninth tablet, which assures him he is not going to die tomorrow."

His trusted inner-core staff include his con-artist, Italian half-brother Harry Binelli (Chico Marx) and Binelli's mute cousin Faker Englund (Harpo Marx). They are staying in a fancy Midtown Hotel and hope to put on a good show.Miller and his group have assembled the cast and crew of the play in the hotel ballroom, as well as a substantial debt to the hotel. Miller is planning on skipping out on the hotel without paying the bill when he receives word that one of his actresses, Christine Marlowe (Lucille Ball), has arranged for a backer, the mysterious Zachary Fisk. Miller must keep his room and hide the cast and crew until the meeting with the backer can take place.At the same time, a troubleshooter for the hotel chain, Gregory Wagner (Donald MacBride) discovers the debt. Assured by hotel manager Joe Gribble (Cliff Dunstan), who happens to be Miller's brother-in-law, that Miller had skipped, Wagner is surprised to find Miller still in his room, now joined by the play's author, Leo Davis (Frank Albertson), who has arrived in town and checked into Miller's room.When Wagner threatens to evict Miller before the backer can arrive, Miller and Binelli convince Davis to pretend to be sick. To obtain food, Miller promises waiter Sasha Smirnoff (Alexander Asro) a part in the play. When Davis leaves to spoon with girlfriend Hilda Manney (Ann Miller), Faker takes over as the sick patient examined by a doctor brought in by Mr. Wagner. Wagner leaves to confront the crowd in the ballroom, while the doctor examines the patient. To delay the doctor giving his report to Wagner, Binelli and Miller tie him up, gag him, and lock him in the bathroom. The agent for Mr. Fisk arrives to sign over the check, the doctor breaks free in the bathroom, and the agent is hit on the head accidentally as Faker chases a flying turkey around with a baseball bat. The agent just wants to escape the madness, but reluctantly signs over the check, and leaves.Davis returns and says he heard the agent saying he'll cancel the check, and just signed it to get out of the room. Wagner is fooled into believing all is okay, and upgrades the boys to a fancier room. Later, as the play is about to open, the check from Fisk bounces, Miller, Binelli, and Faker manipulate Wagner into believing he's driven the play's author to take poison. They pretend to give Davis large quantities of Ipecac which is actually drank by Faker, who eventually pretends to die. Wagner is bluffed into believing it's all his fault and helps take the \"body\" down to the alley. As Miller and Wagner prop Faker on a crate, a passing policeman asks what's going on. Miller bluffs their way out of the situation, so he and Wagner make an escape, leaving Faker \"asleep\".They go to watch the end of the play, which is a scene where the miners are bringing a body from out of the mine. The body on the stretcher is Faker's. Wagner realizes he's been duped as the play is greeted with thunderous applause and a revived Davis appears next to Wagner at the back of the theater."

Hungry on the streets of New York, she is befriended by a young woman (Patsy Kelly) named Peggy .

He lives in the adjacent apartment and works as a subway motorman while studying by mail to be a chiropractor.. Naturally Peggy gets the heiress a job as a shop girl at her own employer's (which is part of a chain the heiress owns.in). In hot water for losing the heiress, the reporter comes up with a new angle--writing a story on the women of the heiress's age slaving away in her store to make her profits.

They both board a ship bound for Cuba, where the lawyer flees to the plantation of a friend, only to discover the friend has died and the plantation is owned by another man. The husband mistakes the plantation owner for the lover and challenges him to a duel with swords. The lawyer tries to break it up, and both he and the husband end up dumped in a pond by the enraged plantation owner. The film was intended to provide transitions between acts of a stage play, and is thus fragmentary and missing plot elements of the overall whole. In its complete 66 minute version, it also includes multiple takes of the same scene. There is a shorter version not edited by Welles that removes the multiple takes, reorders scenes, and adds title cards that were created based on information from the play, not from materials Welles himself created."
